# Integrate Mercado Pago
<br/>

Connect a Mercado Pago account to the module to capture your sales charges in WooCommerce. It’s easy! You only need to have a merchant account in Mercado Pago and obtain the test and production credentials.

> NOTE

> You don't need to know how to design or program to activate Mercado Pago in your WooCommerce store.

Once the module is installed, follow these steps to integrate:

1. Create a [seller account](https://www.mercadopago.com.ar/registration-company?confirmation_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mercadopago.com.ar%2Fcomo-cobrar)  in Mercado Pago if you don’t have one yet.
2. Obtain the Access Token and Public Key [credentials](https://www.mercadopago.com.ar/developers/en/guides/localization/credentials) and paste them into the Production and Testing fields that you will find in the module configuration.
3. Approve the account to [go to Production](https://www.mercadopago.com.ar/developers/en/guides/payments/api/goto-production/) and receive money from your sales in Mercado Pago.
4. Done! With this you can capture the payments you receive in WooCommerce with your Mercado Pago account.

> WARNING

> Important
>
> The [credentials](https://www.mercadopago.com.ar/developers/en/guides/localization/credentials) are the keys that uniquely identify you within the platform. To operate in a **test environment** with which to simulate online payments, use the test credentials. Use **production** credentials to receive real payments.
