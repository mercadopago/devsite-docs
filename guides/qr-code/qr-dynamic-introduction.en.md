# What is the dynamic QR model?

It allows the inclusion of the payment value in the QR code. Each QR represents a single order and amount. **Its main characteristic is the one-time payment**, meaning that reusing the QR is not allowed after completing the payment.

This model is ideal for collections with QR codes on ticket and desktop services or value-included payments.


## Model description

The main characteristics are:

- The value is already configured in the QR code.
- Allows you to display the QR code on a printed ticket or POS device. A fixed QR code at the point of sale is not required.
- You can charge several orders simultaneously with different codes.
