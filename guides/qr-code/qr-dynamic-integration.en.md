# How to integrate the QR Dynamic Model

For collecting with a Dynamic Model QR code, you must generate an order and, depending on the obtained response, create a code using an external service.

## Model flow

Find below how this model works:

1. Create an order with all the necessary payment information.
2. The response will include a data string under the attribute `qr_data`.
3. Generate a QR code with the received attribute.
4. Finally, provide the QR code to the customer for payment, as you prefer.

There are two ways to follow these steps: **creating an order**, or **creating an order associated to a POS**. We'll see them next.

## Create an order

First of all, generate the order publication. Once the data is sent to Mercado Pago, a string with the standard [EMVCo](https://www.emvco.com/emv-technologies/qrcodes) will be available.

To create an order, access our [API Reference](/developers/en/reference/qr-dynamic/_instore_orders_qr_seller_collectors_user_id_pos_external_pos_id_qrs/post) and execute the curl you will find there. The response will include the data required to create the QR code.

**Response**

```json
{
  "qr_data": "00020101021243650016COM.MERCADOLIBRE02013063638f1192a-5fd1-4180-a180-8bcae3556bc35204000053039865802BR5925IZABEL AAAA DE MELO6007BARUERI62070503***63040B6D"
}
```

The response will be a string with the EMVCo standard. Use the `qr_data` to make the QR code available with a generator or by your application.

----[mlb]----
If you have a **Pix key configured** in your Mercado Pago account, the string structure will contain Pix-related data.
For example:

```json
{
  "qr_data": "00020101021226940014BR.GOV.BCB.PIX2572pix-qr.mercadopago.com/instore/o/v2/fdf9ece0-6137-4e1e-a49d-94f55ec9eee25204000053039865802BR5925FELIPE AAAAAA AAAAA 6009SAO PAULO62070503***6304B61D"
}
```

------------

## Crear an order associated with a POS

In addition to generating the QR code, you also have the option to create and assign the same order to the point of saleâ€™s fixed QR code.

Execute the API call detailed [in this section of our API Reference](/developers/en/reference/qr-dynamic/_instore_orders_qr_seller_collectors_user_id_pos_external_pos_id_qrs/put) to generate the order and assign it to the POS. The response will contain the data required to create the QR code, associated with the declared QR.

## Receive orders notifications

An IPN (Instant Payment Notification) notification is an **automatic message that notifies the creation of new orders and their status updates**. I.e.: If an order is approved, rejected, or pending.

Go to [IPN notifications](/developers/en/docs/qr-code/additional-content/your-integrations/notifications/ipn) to learn how to implement them, more specifically the `merchant_order` notifications, which are the ones associated with orders. You will be able to identify each one of theses orders by the `external_reference` parameter.
