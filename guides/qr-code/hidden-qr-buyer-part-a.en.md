## What is the QR Buyer model?

It is a model that allows charging by reading a QR code generated by Mercado Pago application on the customer's account. This model is used for self-service machines or systems that have QR reading, such as restaurants, cinemas and parking lots.

> In Brazil, this product is MVP (Minimum Viable Product). By default, we do not have a QR for a collection that is intrinsically enabled in this application, because both buyer and seller profiles must be released from the equipment before they can be used.

## QR Buyer model characteristics

The main characteristics are:

- The charge is made by reading the QR Buyer.
- Each QR scan will represent a charge.
- Allows offline payments (without internet connection) to the payer.
- By submitting the billing API, the payment validation takes place synchronously.
