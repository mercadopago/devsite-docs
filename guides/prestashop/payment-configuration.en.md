# Payment configuration

The integration of the Mercado Pago module with the PrestaShop store allows you to use two types of checkouts to receive payments for your sales, namely:

----[mlb]---- 
* [Checkout Pro](/developers/en/docs/prestashop/payment-configuration/checkout-pro): payment is made on the Mercado Pago page (inside or outside your store) with cards (debit or credit), cash (Mercado Pago account or boleto bancário) and bank transfer (Pix or PEC).
* [Checkout Transparente](/developers/en/docs/prestashop/payment-configuration/checkout-api/introduction): payment is made without leaving your virtual store with cards (debit or credit), ticket checkout (Mercado Pago account balance or boleto bancário) and Pix.
