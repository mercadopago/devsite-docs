* [Checkout Pro](/developers/en/docs/prestashop/payment-configuration/checkout-pro): payment is made on the Mercado Pago page (inside or outside your store) with cards (debit or credit), cash (Mercado Pago account or boleto bancário) and bank transfer (Pix).
* [Checkout Transparente](/developers/en/docs/prestashop/payment-configuration/checkout-api/introduction): payment is made without leaving your virtual store with cards (debit or credit), ticket checkout (Mercado Pago account balance or boleto bancário) and Pix.
