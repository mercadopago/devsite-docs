# Sales Processing
 
With all the steps completed, your customers will be able to make purchases in your store. When performing a transaction, it is common for some messages to return with specific information about the purchase, as every sale generates a payment status that shows the status of the sale including confirmation, pending or rejection of payment and other important information about the transaction.
 
For more information, access the [Activities](https://www.mercadopago[FAKER][URL][DOMAIN]/activities) section of your Mercado Pago account.
