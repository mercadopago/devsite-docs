## Mercado Pago with Checkout Pro

With Checkout Pro, the buyer will be directed from the store to the Mercado Pago website, where they must complete the requested information and make the payment. In this way, the transaction is processed and completed outside of the store environment. It is not necessary for the buyer to have a Mercado Pago account and, at the end of the transaction, the buyer can be returned to the store.

1. To activate the checkout, you must click on the slider button.
2. In the field **Title in the store checkout** you can choose the name with which this payment method will be displayed in the store. For example, you can name it **Mercado Pago**.
3. The option **Convert currency** allows the value of the currency configured in WooCommerce to be compatible with the value of the currency you use in Mercado Pago. If you want to activate it, you just have to click on the slider button.
4. In **Choose the payment methods accepted in the store** you can choose which payment methods you will accept in the store through Mercado Pago Checkout Pro. These might be:
----[mlb]----
    - Debit and credit cards.
