# Test the integration

To verify that the store is configured correctly, we recommend that you test your store before launching it into production.
To activate test mode for your store, follow these steps:

1. Go to your [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/) account.
2. Access your account Dashboard and click **Plugins > Installed Plugins**.
3. In the plugin search engine, search for “Mercado Pago payments for WooCommerce”.
4. Click **Configure Plugin**.
5. Click **4. Test your store before selling** to display the options.
6. Under **Choose how you want to run your store**, select **Test Mode**.
7. Click **Save Changes** to finish.

## CheckoutPro
1. Select the option **I want to pay with Mercado Pago at no additional cost**.
1. Click **order with mandatory payment** to be redirected to the Mercado Pago payment environment.
1. On the payment screen, choose to pay with a new credit card and use the [test cards](/developers/es/docs/woocommerce/additional-content/your-integrations/test/cards) to make the payment. It is important not to log in to the Mercado Pago account or try to pay with cards for personal use.
1. Add the information of the indicated test card (card number, CVV and expiration date).
1. At the end of the purchase, you will be able to view, within Mercado Pago, proof that the purchase was made and you will be redirected back to the store.

> When finalizing the test purchase with Checkout Pro, in the WooCommerce Admin Panel it will not be possible to view the purchase as approved because the process takes place within the Mercado Pago environment and not in the store environment. With testing done with Checkout Transparente you will be able to view the order approval.<br>

> In addition, in both checkouts this information about the approved payment will not be included in the Mercado Pago account history because it only contains real expenses (made in production).
