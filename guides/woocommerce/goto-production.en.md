# Go to production

The first step in activating production mode on your store is to **enable the SSL certificate** on your domain. This certificate is used to increase the security of the data shared by your store, that is, the personal information of your customers.

Many hosting services offer, along with the domain, the SSL certificate. If your domain does not have this certificate, we recommend looking for a service that can help you with the purchase and installation.

For more information, please visit our documentation [Requirements to go to production](/developers/en/docs/woocommerce/additional-content/goto-production).

With the certificate activated and testing completed, you can take your store out of test mode and enable production mode. This will allow you to make real sales.

Follow this step by step to make the change:

1. Go to your [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/) account.
2. Access your account Dashboard and click **Plugins > Installed Plugins**.
3. In the plugin search engine, search for “Mercado Pago payments for WooCommerce”.
4. Click **Configure Plugin**.
5. Click **4. Test your store before selling** to display the options.
6. Under Choose how you want to operate your store, select **Sales Mode (Production)**.
7. Click **Save Changes** to finish.

Done! The store is in production and enabled to process your sales.
