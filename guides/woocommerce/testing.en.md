# Testing Purchases

With the store in test mode, you can test purchases before enabling them for the public. To do this, perform the entire purchase flow until completion at checkout and select the option **credit card payment**, as shown in the instructions below.

1. Logout of your Mercado Pago account so that you can simulate the purchase as a customer not associated with Mercado Pago.
2. Access your store's homepage on WordPress.
3. Select a product and click on **Add to cart > View cart**.
4. Choose any shipping option and click on **Proceed to checkout**.
5. Fill in the required information and select the payment option with the Mercado Pago solution you have configured.
6. Select **credit card payment** and use the credit card information available on our page [Test local credit cards](/developers/en/docs/woocomerce/additional-content/test-cards).
7. When you finish completing the fields, click on **Place order**.

If the test runs without errors, it means your store is ready to sell. However, we recommend you perform additional tests so that you can view the different payment results.
