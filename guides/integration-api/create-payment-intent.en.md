#  Start processing your payments

To start processing your payments with POS, follow the steps below.

## Get the list of your available devices

Before creating a payment intent, you must obtain the list of Point devices associated with your account. You can do it through the following call:

``` curl
curl --location --request GET 'https://api.mercadopago.com/point/integration-api/devices?offset=0&limit=50' \ 
--header 'Authorization: Bearer ${ACCESS_TOKEN}' 
```

You will receive a response like this:


```json
{
    "devices": [
        {
            "id": "INGENICO_MOVE2500__ING-ARG-1123345670",
            "pos_id": 47792476,
            "store_id": "47792478",
            "external_pos_id": "SUC0101POS",
            "operating_mode": "PDV"
        },
        {
            "id": "INGENICO_MOVE2500__ING-ARG-0987654P",
            "pos_id": 47792476,
            "store_id": "47792478",
            "external_pos_id": "SUC0101POS",
            "operating_mode": "STANDALONE"
        },
        {
            "id": "INGENICO_MOVE2500__ING-5467853",
            "operating_mode": "PDV",

            "store_id": "47792478",
            "external_pos_id": "SUC0101POS",
        },
        {
            "id": "INGENICO_MOVE2500__ING-ARG-1233456",
            "pos_id": 47792476,
            "store_id": "47792478",
            "external_pos_id": "SUC0101POS",
            "operating_mode": "STANDALONE"
        }
    ],
    "paging": {
        "total": 4,

        "offset": 0
    }
}

```


## Create the payment intent

A payment intent is a call that contains all the details of the transaction to be made, and it must be created in order to start a payment. It is an attempt that, if successful, will return a payment `id`  and its status.

You can create a payment intent and assign it to your Point device in the following way:

----[mla]----
```curl
curl --location --request POST 'https://api.mercadopago.com/point/integration-api/devices/{{device.id}}/payment-intents' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer ${ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
--data-raw '{
   "amount": 1500,
   "additional_info": {
       "external_reference": "4561ads-das4das4-das4754-das456",
       "print_on_terminal": true,
       "ticket_number": "S0392JED"
   }
}'
```

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `amount` | Total amount of the payment intent. <br>**Minimum amount allowed**: 500 (POS and SMART devices). <br>**Maximum amount allowed**: 400000000 (both devices). <br>**Important**: this field does not allow decimal points. Therefore, if you want to generate a payment intent, you must consider the two decimals of the value in its total. For example: to generate payment order value "15.00" you must enter "1500". |
| `external_reference` | Field exclusively used by the integrator to include references to their system. |
| `print_on_terminal` | Field that determines if the device prints the payment receipt. |
| `ticket_number` | Ticket number of the payment intent. |

In response, you will receive something similar to this:

```json
{
 "id": "7d8c70b6-2ac8-4c57-a441-c319088ca3ca",
 "device_id": "INGENICO_MOVE2500__ING-ARG-14886780",
 "amount": 1500,
 "additional_info": {
     "external_reference": "4561ads-das4das4-das4754-das456",
     "print_on_terminal": true,
     "ticket_number": "S0392JED"
 }
}

| `amount` | Total amount of the payment intent. <br>**Minimum amount allowed**: 100 (POS and SMART devices). <br>**Maximum amount allowed**: 7000000 (both devices). <br>**Important**: this field does not allow decimal points. Therefore, if you want to generate a payment intent, you must consider the two decimals of the value in its total. For example: to generate payment order value "15.00" you must enter "1500". |
| `description` | Description of payment intent. |
| `payment.type` | Payment method type. |
| `payment.installments` | Number of payment installments |
| `payment.installments_cost` | Cost for payment installments. This field determines who takes the cost and the accepted values are `seller` and `buyer`. |
| `external_reference` | Field exclusively used by the integrator to include references to their system. |
| `print_on_terminal` | Field that determines if the device prints the payment receipt. |

## Cancel a payment intent

You can cancel a payment intent assigned to a Point device in the following way:


``` curl
curl --location --request DELETE 'https://api.mercadopago.com/point/integration-api/devices/:deviceId/payment-intents/:paymentIntentId' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer ${ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
```

You will receive this response:

``` json
{
 "id": "7d8c70b6-2ac8-4c57-a441-c319088ca3ca"
}
```

## Process your payment intent

Once the payment intent has been created, you can obtain it from your Point device by pressing on the key to pay (in the case of Point Plus and Point Pro 2 the **green button** and, in the case of the Point Smart, the **digital button “Charge now”**). You must follow the steps shown on the screen afterwards to complete the payment.

> Important
>
> We recommend assessing your [integration’s quality](/developers/en/docs/checkout-api/additional-content/integration-quality) to check if you are meeting the Mercado Pago quality and security standards that would help you obtain a good payment approval rate.

## Check the status of your payment intent

You can check the current status of your payment intent using the `id` that you received in the response when creating it.

Remember that `id`and `status`of the **payment intent** are not the same as `id`and `status`of the payment. In this case, you will be trying to obtain the details of an attempt. If you want to check out all the information corresponding to the payment, access the [Payment API section](https://www.mercadopago[FAKER][URL][DOMAIN]/developers/en/reference/payments/_payments_id/get) in our API Reference.
