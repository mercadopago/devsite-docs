# Configure notifications

If you wish, you can receive notifications from Webhooks. These are sent from our Integrations API to your receiving system through an `HTTP POST` call in relation to the status changes presented by a payment intent.

To integrate Webhook notifications, follow the instructions shown in [this documentation](/developers/en/docs/mp-point/additional-content/your-integrations/notifications/webhooks).

> WARNING

> The `notification_url` field mentioned in the notifications documentation is not supported by the integrations API.
