Due to a Information Disclosure issue, we'll be hidding some of the payer's contact information for **non approved payments**. 

This means that any `GET` or `POST` request over **/v1/payments**  will be giving a response like the following: 

```json
...
    "payer": {
        "type": null,
        "id": 12345,
        "email": null,
        "identification": {
            "type": null,
            "number": null
        },
        "phone": {
            "area_code": null,
            "number": null,
            "extension": null
        },
        "first_name": null,
        "last_name": null,
        "entity_type": null
    },
```



- **What about Sandbox?**: We'll be giving you mock and static values.
