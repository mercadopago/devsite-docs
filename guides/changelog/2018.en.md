At Mercado Pago we always try to optimize our platform offering the highest efficiency and security in payment processing.

We are currently working on migrating our API version 0 to version 1 in order to maintain the highest quality standards.

After this deadline, version 0 will be disabled and any attempt to connect using it will fail.

The migration will involve the following resources:

- We are working on the **end of support of TLS 1.0** for the domains [https://api.mercadopago.com](https://api.mercadopago.com) and [https://pagamento.mercadopago.com](https://pagamento.mercadopago.com) with the objective of maintaining the highest quality standards and promoting the security of our clients' data.

- As of June 30, 2018 we will require that the connections to these domains be through the encryption protocol TLS 1.1 or higher. More information in [this article](/guides/pci-compliant-merchants/disabling-tls-10.es.md)


## June 14 2018

Due to a Information Disclosure issue, we'll be hidding some of the payer's contact information for **non approved payments**.

This means that any `GET` or `POST` request over **/v1/payments**  will be giving a response like the following:

```json
...
    "payer": {
        "type": null,
        "id": 12345,
        "email": null,
        "identification": {
            "type": null,
            "number": null
        },
        "phone": {
            "area_code": null,
            "number": null,
            "extension": null
        },
        "first_name": null,
        "last_name": null,
        "entity_type": null
    },
```



- **What about Sandbox?**: We'll be giving you mock and static values.
- This changes will have effect over payments **off**  Mercado Libre's platform.
