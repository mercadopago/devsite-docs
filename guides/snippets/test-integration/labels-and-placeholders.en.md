## Labels and placeholders

**Labels** are the names of each input and indicate which detail should be entered. They should be constantly visible so that users can scan and fill out the form faster, since they work as a guide and prevent users from having to remember what information they should enter. 

In turn, the **placeholders** are the filler texts of each input. They serve to exemplify or explain the data to be entered. Take advantage of this instance to place formatting or actionable examples.
It is important to know that the placeholder disappears when the cursor is placed on the input or the data is completed. Take this feature into account and avoid using them as the only reference for your inputs so that the user does not have to make an effort to remember what data goes in each field, or has to delete what was entered if they want to confirm it. 

Both the labels and the placeholders must be short, direct and clear to prevent users from making mistakes.
