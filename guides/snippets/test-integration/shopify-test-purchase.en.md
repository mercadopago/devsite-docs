Testing helps ensure that payments are processed correctly before allowing actual sales.

Follow the steps below to make a test purchase in your store.

1. Go to your store's home page and select a product to purchase.
2. Click on **Buy it now** and proceed to your cart.
3. Enter a zip code to simulate shipping and click on **Continue**.
4. Fill in the required fields and select Mercado Pago as payment method.
5. Click on **Check out**.

If the test runs without errors, it means the installation was done correctly and your store is ready to sell.
