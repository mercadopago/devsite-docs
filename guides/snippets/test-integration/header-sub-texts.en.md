## Headings, subheadings and explanatory texts

Keep the data grouped thematically and provide context to the user about the steps to follow to complete their transaction. This will help scannability and make the user feel more secure when sharing their information. For this, we recommend you use:

* **Headings**: use them to group the required details by theme and to indicate the users which section they are  in.
* **Subheadings**: use them to give context or explain which action is expected.
* **Explanatory texts**: use them to provide explanations or deepen information, whenever necessary, to avoid doubts.
