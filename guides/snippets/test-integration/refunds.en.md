Refunds can be made in two ways: **full**, when the total sale amount is returned to the buyer, or **partial**, when only part of the paid amount is returned to the buyer.

Before performing a refund, it is important to consider the factors below.

* **Refund Deadline:** It is possible to refund a payment within 180 days of its approval date.
* **Account Balance:** You must have sufficient balance available in your account to refund the amount, otherwise the transaction will not be concluded.
* **Payment method:** For payments by credit card, the amount will be refunded directly on the invoice. For other payment methods such as Pix, for example, the amount will be returned to the payer's account.
