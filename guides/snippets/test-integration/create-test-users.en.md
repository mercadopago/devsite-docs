Use test accounts to ensure that your integration supports all possible flows and scenarios. They have the same features as a real Mercado Pago account, which allows you to test the functioning of the integrations you are developing.

To perform the test, you must have at least two accounts:

* **Seller**: account required to **configure application and credentials**. This is your user account.
* **Buyer**: account required to **test the purchase process**.

In addition to these accounts, it is also important to use [test cards](/developers/en/guides/additional-content/testing/test-cards) to test payment integration and simulate the purchase process, as well as **balance in the test user's Mercado Pago account**. See more details below.

To create accounts and test how the integrations work, follow the steps below.

1. In [Devsite](/developers/en/docs), access the menu **Your Integrations > Test Accounts** and click on the **Create Test Account** button.
2. On the "Create New Account" screen, enter a description for the account identification. Example: "Salesperson - store 1".
3. Next, select the **country of operation** for the account. This information **cannot be edited later** and, in addition, Buyer and Seller users must be from the same country.
4. Fill in a **fictitious amount of money** that will serve as a reference for you to test your applications. This amount will appear as a balance in the test user's Mercado Pago account and can be used to simulate payments, as well as with a [test card](/developers/en/guides/additional-content/testing/test-cards).
5. Click **Create Test Account**.
