To perform the tests, **you must have at least two users:** a seller and a buyer.

Execute the following curl to generate a test user:

```curl
curl -X POST \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer PROD_ACCESS_TOKEN' \
"https://api.mercadopago.com/users/test_user" \
-d '{"site_id":"[FAKER][GLOBALIZE][UPPER_SITE_ID]"}'
```

The answer will have a structure similar to the following example:

```json
{
    "id": 123456,
    "nickname": "TT123456",
    "password": "qatest123456",
    "site_status": "active",
    "email": "test_user_123456@testuser.com"
}
```

>WARNING

> Important
>
> * You can generate up to 10 test user accounts simultaneously. Therefore, we recommend you _save each email and password._
> * Test users expire after 60 days without activity in Mercado Pago.
> * Both buyer and seller must be test users.
