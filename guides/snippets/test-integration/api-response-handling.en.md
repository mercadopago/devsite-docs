For improved payment approval, you need to correctly inform results to your customers when making or creating a payment.

This will prevent rejections and chargebacks in the case of already approved transactions.  For example, this allows you to correct data upload mistakes or change payment methods.

We recommend using [response handling](https://www.mercadopago[FAKER][URL][DOMAIN]/developers/en/guides/online-payments/checkout-api/handling-responses) and the suggested communication in each case.
