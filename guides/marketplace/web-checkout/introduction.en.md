# Introduction

A **MarketPlace** is a website or application that allows sellers and buyers to interact with each other to make commercial transactions. The owner of a Marketplace provides a space for sellers to display their products or services and is responsible for managing all aspects of the transaction. For example, Mercado Libre is a Marketplace.

Mercado Pago allows you to collect payments on behalf of the sellers of your platform and optionally charge a commission for the transaction.

When a payment is generated, the amount is immediately divided between the seller's account and your account, in case you charge a fee.

The Marketplace requires 3 steps:

1. **Create a Marketplace** application.
2. **Connect** your sellers' accounts.
3. **Charge** on behalf of them.

After creating the application, you only need to take the second and third steps for each subsequent vendor.


### Credentials

Your <a href="[FAKER][CREDENTIALS][URL]" target="_blank"> credentials </a> are the **keys we provide so you can configure your integrations.**. 

* The public key, or Public Key, is used to access the resources that your frontend needs. You will be able to collect credit card data and convert it into a representative token that you can safely store on your servers to create a payment.


* The private key, or Access Token, will allow you to call the rest of the APIs. For example, how to process a payment, make a refund or store cards.
