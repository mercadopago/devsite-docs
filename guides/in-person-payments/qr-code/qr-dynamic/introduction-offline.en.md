# QR dynamic model
	
## What is dynamic QR?

Dynamic QR allows to have the amount collectible already included in the QR. That is, each QR represents a single order and amount. 

Recommended to use for **desk service model**, for payments with amount included, among others.


## Model characteristics

The main characteristics are:
- The amount is already configured in the QR.
- It allows for repeated payments with the same amount.
- The model is based on an EMVCo defined standard.
- It allows to generate multi-wallet and offline dynamic QR codes.

## How does it work?

2. Then, generate a QR code with previously created content.
3. Finally, show the QR code the way you prefer for the customer to pay.
