# How to generate QR codes

Depending on your business needs, you have different options when it comes to creating QR codes. You can also combine methods to offer your client a unique buying experience in your physical store.


## Generating QR by the Mercado Pago panel

This is the simplest way to charge with QR: you **don't need an integration between your system and Mercado Pago in order to work**.
There are various ways of doing it. Consult all available information to [generate reports from this panel](https://www.mercadopago[FAKER][URL][DOMAIN]/developers/en/guides/in-person-payments/qr-code/integrations-front).

## Generating integrated QR 

Provide a more complete experience for QR payments by **integrating your system with Mercado Pago**.

You’ll be able to charge, refund and receive notifications in your system.
