# In-Store Payments with QR Codes

You can boost in-store sales by using QR codes to get paid.
The mobile app of MercadoPago allows its users to securely store their credit cards, debit cards and use the available account balance. Its main features are:

* Make the payment of services.
* Top up mobile phones.
* Send and receive cash between MercadoPago accounts.
* In-store payments.

Customers using the mobile app of MercadoPago scan the QR code and make the payment using their stored cards or account balance.

This allows you to offer in your physical stores payments in installments without interest and the benefits offered by MercadoPago.

To make the payment, your customers need to download the app on their mobile phone:

> [Android Play Store]  (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mercadopago.wallet&hl=es_419)  
> [iOS App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/ar/app/mercado-pago/id925436649?mt=8)



There are different alternatives to receive payments using QR codes:

* By generating a QR code linked to your MercadoPago account. The customer scans your QR code and can transfer the money.  The amount must be entered manually.
* By generating a QR code with fixed amount, to be displayed in your store next to the product offered so that your customers can purchase it by simply scanning the code.
* By integrating in your management system the payment method via QR code.  Customers scan the QR code, which allows them to view on their mobile phone the description of what they purchased and the amount to be paid.

Based on your business model, you can choose one of the options or combine them to offer your customers a great shopping experience in your physical stores.
