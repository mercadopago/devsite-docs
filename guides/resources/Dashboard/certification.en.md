# Your certifications

This area displays the certificates of completion and the badges obtained after passing the certification exam chosen in the **<dev>program**, the benefits program for developers at Mercado Pago.

The **certificates** can be downloaded from your computer's local files, in addition to having different colors for each certification and an authentication QR Code. The file can also be shared on social networks and there will be the possibility of creating a public sharing link.

The **badges** act as a badge to identify developers who have already completed our official certification process and, like the certificates, have different colors for each type of certification. They can also be downloaded to your computer's local files and added to a professional profile through HTML, for example.

Check the [<dev>program](https://www.mercadopago[FAKER][URL][DOMAIN]/developers/en/developer-program) page for more information.
