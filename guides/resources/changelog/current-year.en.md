In order to optimize your sales, we have added a new attribute that will allow you to receive payments only from registered users, in the Checkout Pro. This means that your buyers will pay you exclusively with their saved cards or with their account balance.

Our payment IDs will now be 11 digits long. Our APIs and SDKs operate on data type `long` so this change should not impact your integration with Mercado Pago.
If you have any doubts, we recommend reviewing how you manage and store our Payment ID in your integration in order to avoid any inconvenience.

In order to help you optimize your reconciliations, we made some changes in the generation of the date ranges for your scheduled reports. This change applies to both the Available Balance report and Account Balance report. After April 1st, 2020 to find your scheduled reports, you will have to search for them by one second less. 

 `Search` Filters | Actual Date | New Date |
--------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
begin_date  | 01/01/2020 00:00:00 | 01/01/2020 00:00:00
end_date | 02/01/2020 00:00:00 |  01/01/2020  23:59:59

Your new parameter will look as follows:

```
https://api.mercadolibre.com/account/bank_report/search?access_token={{access_token}}
	&created_from=schedule
	&user_id=290477154
	&begin_date=2020-01-01T00:00:00Z
