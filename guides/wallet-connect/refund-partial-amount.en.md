# Refund partial amount


To refund a partial amount, that is, to refund only part of the amount paid, it is necessary to indicate the amount that must be returned directly in the `body` of the request. To do so, send a **POST** to the endpoint [/v1/advanced_payments/{advanced_payment_id}/refunds](/developers/enreference/wallet_connect/_advanced_payments_advanced_payment_id_refunds/post) with the appropriate information and execute the request or, if you prefer , use the `curl` below.

[[[
```curl

curl -X POST \
'https://api.mercadopago.com/v1/advanced_payments/ADVANCED_PAYMENT_ID/refunds' \
  -H 'X-Idempotency-Key: IDEMPOTENCY_KEY' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{
        "amount":25
      }'

```
