# Capture payment

The payment capture is a confirmation of the amount you want to charge from the buyer. At this point in the payment flow, the seller needs a certain payment to be withdrawn from the customer's wallet at the time of its creation.

See the diagram below that illustrates the payment capture process via the Wallet Connect API Payments endpoint.
