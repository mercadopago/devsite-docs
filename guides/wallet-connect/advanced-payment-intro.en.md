# Payment flow

Payment flows are specific configurations for Wallet Connect in which the integrator obtains a "payer token" from the payer when carrying out the Agreement flow. This "payer token" is used by the integrator to make the payment from the payer's digital wallet.

> It is only possible to consume the Advanced Payments API after the end of the Agreement flow. For more information on how to create an agreement, see section [Create agreement](/developers/en/docs/wallet-connect/integration-configuration/create-agreement).

In this documentation you will find the following endpoints for integration with Advanced Payments:

* [Capture payment](/developers/en/docs/wallet-connect/advanced-payments/capture-payment)
* [Idempotency](/developers/en/docs/wallet-connect/advanced-payments/idempotency)
* [Get payment information](/developers/en/docs/wallet-connect/advanced-payments/get-payment-information)
* [Refund payments (full and partial)](/developers/en/docs/wallet-connect/advanced-payments/refund-payment)
