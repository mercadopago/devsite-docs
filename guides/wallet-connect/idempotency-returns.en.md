Status code: 400
===
{
   "status": "400",
   "error":  "bad_request",
   "message": "Some parameters are invalid for search.",
}

```

## Failed due to conflict

This failure occurs when an payment is created and it is being processed or has already been paid. In this case, the idempotency process is not fulfilled and therefore it is rejected.

[[[
```Json
===
Status code: 409
===
{
   "status": "409",
   "error":  "Conflict",
   "message": "The process has not been completed yet. Try again later.",
   "cause": [
    {
      "code":"401001",
      "message": "The process has not been completed yet. Try again later.",
      "data": null
    }
   ]
}

```
]]]

## Failed due to unprocessable entity

This failure occurs when creating an payment, an error or some empty information is identified. When this happens, the idempotency process is not fulfilled, becoming an unprocessable entity and therefore it is rejected.

Status code: 422
===
{
   "status": "422",
   "error":  "Unprocessable entity",
   "message": "Idempotency key already used.",

      "message": "Idempotency key already used.",
      "data": null
    }
   ]
}
