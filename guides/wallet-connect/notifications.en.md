# Notifications

## Webhooks

Webhook (also known as web callback) is a simple method that makes it easy for an app or system to provide real-time information whenever an event happens, that is, it is a way to passively receive data between two systems through an HTTP POST.

Webhooks notifications can be configured for one or more applications created in your Dashboard.

Once configured, the Webhook will be sent whenever one or more registered events occur, avoiding a search job every minute in search of an answer and, consequently, a system overload and data loss whenever there is some situation. After receiving a notification on your platform, Mercado Pago will wait for a response to validate that you received it correctly


### Prerequisites

Before configuring Webhook notifications for Wallet Connect it is important to consider the following prerequisites.

| Requirement  | Description  |
| --- | --- |
| SSL certificate  | Protocol that allows you to establish secure communications over the Internet for activities such as browsing, email, and other data transfers.  |
| Request response  | The endpoint must return a 2XX response code to acknowledge receipt. All response codes outside of 2XXs will trigger exponential retries from Mercado Pago.  |
| Timeout  | To avoid timeout issues, the integrator’ application must return a response before triggering complex logic on its side.  |
| Permission request  | In order to be able to whitelist requests via DNS, requests will come through the api.mercadopago.com endpoint. The integrator must disable CSRF (**Cross-site request forgery**) for api.mercadopago.com, which will allow Mercado Pago requests.  |

### Types of events

There are two different types of events that allow you to receive notifications. These events refer to the update and/or cancellation of an agreement.

#### Cancellation of agreement between integrator and Mercado Pago


In this case, the user has the possibility to unsubscribe from an agreement, which causes the existing contract to be cancelled. When this happens, the `payer_token` is invalidated and no further charges are made to the user. If the integrator makes new collection attempts, it will be rejected.

Check below a code example with the information sent at the time of the request.

[[[
```curl

curl -X POST 'https://api.integrator.com/wallet_connect/events' \

-d '{ 

     id: "11ae6c7564ed497f945f755fcabat8k6",
     type: "wallet_connect",
     entity: "agreement",
     action: "status.updated",
     date: "2021-09-30T23:24:44Z",
     model_version: 1,
     version: 0,
     data: { 

           id: "22ae6c1235ed497f945f755fcaba3c6c",
           status: "cancelled"

     }

}'

```
]]]


#### Agreement payment method update

In this case, the user can add or update a secondary payment method (by default, Mercado Pago account money is the first payment method). Based on payment statuses, it is possible to detect rejected payments and notify the user so that they can perform the update or add a secondary payment method.

Check below a code example with the information sent at the time of the request.

[[[
```curl

curl -X POST 'https://api.integrator.com/wallet_connect/events' \

-d '{ 

     id: "44ae6c7564ed497f945f755fcabat9d4",
     type: "wallet_connect",
     entity: "agreement",
     action: "payment_method.updated",
     date: "2021-09-30T23:24:44Z",
     model_version: 1,
     version: 0,
     data: { 

           id: "22ae6c1235ed497f945f755fcaba3c6c",

     }

}' 

```
]]]
