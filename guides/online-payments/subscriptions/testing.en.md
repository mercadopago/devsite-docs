# Test your subscriptions

We explain how to use our cards and test users to verify that your subscriptions are created correctly.


## How to test your integration

**Test users allow you to test your subscriptions** by generating payment flows with an exact copy of your settings.

User types | Description  
--- |	---
Seller | This is the test account you use to set up your subscription and billing credentials.        
Payer  | This is the test account that you use to test recurring payments.

## How to create users

To start, you need to have at least two test users: a buyer and a seller.

To set up the seller account you can use your test user's credentials. 

Run the following curl to generate a test user:

```curl
curl -X POST \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer PROD_ACCESS_TOKEN' \
"https://api.mercadopago.com/users/test_user" \
-d '{"site_id":"[FAKER][GLOBALIZE][UPPER_SITE_ID]"}'
```

### Response
