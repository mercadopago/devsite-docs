# Integrate subscriptions  

## Integration types

There are two ways to integrate subscriptions: 

* __With an associated plan__: Use this form when you need to use the same subscription on different occasions and want to organize them into identifiable groups. For example, for a monthly and annual subscription to a gym.  

* __Without an associated plan__: Use this form when you know that different subscriptions will not share any features because they will be very specific or specialized for each payer. For example, for a single month subscription with a special discount.

## Subscriptions with an associated plan

If you want to use a subscription with an associated plan, you must first create a plan.  

### Create plan

When generating the plan you will get the `preapproval_plan_id` that you will use to make the subscription. 

To create the plan, make the following call to our API with the data you need:

```curl 
curl --location --request POST 'https://api.mercadopago.com/preapproval_plan' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer ENV_ACCESS_TOKEN' \
--data-raw '{
	"back_url":"https://www.mercadopago[FAKER][URL][DOMAIN]",
	"reason":"Plan Pase Mensual Gold",
	"auto_recurring":{
		"frequency":"1",
		"frequency_type":"months",
        "transaction_amount":1100,
		"currency_id":"[FAKER][CURRENCY][ACRONYM]",
		"repetitions":12,
		"free_trial":{
			"frequency_type":"months",
			"frequency":"1"
		}
	}
}'
```

| --- | --- |
| `reason` (required) | It is the description that the subscriber will see when making the subscription and the detail that will be seen in the card statement. |
| `auto_recurring.frequency` (required) | Indicates the length of time or cycle based on the type of frequency. |
| `auto_recurring.frequency_type` (required) | Indicates the type of frequency. It can be monthy or daily. <br><br> Along with the frequency, they define the installment cycle that a subscription will have. <br><br>For example, if every fifteen days you need to generate an installment to be charged it would look like this: `auto_recurring.frequency`: 15 y `auto_recurring.frequency_type`: days |
| `auto_recurring.transaction_amount` | If we indicate the amount, it is fixed. If this field is blank, it is understood as a variable amount. A maximum of two decimals separated by a period is allowed. |
| `auto_recurring.currency_id` (required) | Identifies the currency that corresponds to the country. |
| `auto_recurring.repetitions` | Indicates if the subscription will have a limit. If not specified, there is no limit. This limit is related to `auto_recurring.frequency` y `auto_recurring.frequency_type`. |
| `auto_recurring.free_trial.frequency` | Defines an initial test period and delays the first collection. Indicates the length of time that the service will not be charged, for based on the type of frequency. It must be consistent with `auto_recurring.frequency`. |
| `auto_recurring.free_trial.frequency_type` | Indicates the number of installments that will not be charged for the service. It must be consistent with `auto_recurring.frequency_type`. |

### Create subscription with pending payment

You can create a subscription with `pending` status and no associated payment method. 

In order to subscribe, the card data must be uploaded with our form. Only the link returned in the `init_point` property must be shared with the payer:

```curl 
curl --location --request POST 'https://api.mercadopago.com/preapproval' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer ENV_ACCESS_TOKEN' \
--data-raw '{
  "auto_recurring": {
    "currency_id": "[FAKER][CURRENCY][ACRONYM]",
    "transaction_amount": 1100,
    "frequency": 1,
    "frequency_type": "months",
    "end_date": "2022-07-20T11:59:52.581-04:00"
  },
  "back_url": "https://www.mercadopago[FAKER][URL][DOMAIN]/",

  "external_reference": "1245AT234562",
  "payer_email": "test_user_XXXX@testuser.com",
  "reason": "Suscripción Pase Mensual Gold - Particular",
