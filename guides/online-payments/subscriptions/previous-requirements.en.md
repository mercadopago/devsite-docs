## First steps

### Access to the Mercado Pago or Mercado Libre account
In order to start the integration, it is necessary to have a Mercado Pago or Mercado Libre account.

If you don't have one yet, you can <a href="https://www.mercadopago[FAKER][URL][DOMAIN]/" target="_blank">create a Mercado Pago account</a> whenever you want.

### Keep your credentials handy

The credentials are the keys that we provide you with, so that you can configure your integration. For this case, you will use a public key and a private key.

To find them, go to the <a href="https://www.mercadopago[FAKER][URL][DOMAIN]/account/credentials/" target="_blank">Credentials</a> section.

>Do you have questions about credentials? You can check our <a href="https://www.mercadopago[FAKER][URL][DOMAIN]/developers/es/support/" target="_blank">Frequently Asked Questions</a>.


### Use our official library

Integrate with our <a href="https://www.mercadopago[FAKER][URL][DOMAIN]/developers/es/guides/sdks" target="_blank">Mercado Pago SDK Javascript</a> which allows you to create a token with your card details securely and send it to your backend for use in your payments.
