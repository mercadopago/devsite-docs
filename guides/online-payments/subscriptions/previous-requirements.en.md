### Keep your credentials handy

The credentials are the **keys that we provide you with, so that you can configure your integration**. For this case, you will use a public key and a private key.

To find them, go to the [Credentials](https://www.mercadopago[FAKER][URL][DOMAIN]/developer/panel/credentials) section.

### Use our official library
