## First steps

### Access to an account
In order to start the integration, it is necessary to **have a Mercado Pago or Mercado Libre account**.

You can [Sign in](https://www.mercadolibre.com/jms/[FAKER][GLOBALIZE][SITE_ID]/lgz/login?platform_id=mp&go=https://www.mercadopago[FAKER][URL][DOMAIN]/developers/en/guides/online-payments/subscriptions/previous-requirements) with an existing Mercado Pago or Mercado Libre account or [Create a new account](https://www.mercadopago[FAKER][URL][DOMAIN]) at Mercado Pago.

### Keep your credentials handy

The credentials are the **keys that we provide you with, so that you can configure your integration**. For this case, you will use a public key and a private key.

To find them, go to the [Credentials](https://www.mercadopago[FAKER][URL][DOMAIN]/developer/panel/credentials) section.

>Do you have questions about credentials? You can check our [FAQs](https://www.mercadopago[FAKER][URL][DOMAIN]/developers/es/guides/resources/faqs/credentials).


### Use our official library

Integrate with our [Mercado Pago SDK Javascript](https://www.mercadopago[FAKER][URL][DOMAIN]/developers/es/guides/sdks) which allows you to create a token with your card details securely and send it to your backend for use in your payments.
