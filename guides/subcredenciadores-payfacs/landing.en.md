 - benefit_title: Subacquirer
 - benefit_message: It is a legal entity that enables other companies or individuals to accept card payments, mediating payment transactions on behalf of submerchants and settling the revenue into their respective bank accounts.
 - benefit_title: Marketplace
 - benefit_message: It is a site or platform that sells its own products or services and those of third parties, facilitating payment transactions and settling the revenue into their respective bank accounts. It is subject to the same rules as a subacquirer because it intermediates the financial flow for the submerchant.
