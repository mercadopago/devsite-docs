# Introduction to subscriptions with Web Checkout

Mercado Pago allows you to receive recurring payments through subscriptions in just two steps:

1. **Define a plan**, which establishes the amount to be billed and the billing frequency.
2. **Add your client**, opening the checkout in order to capture the credit card data

## Credentials

You have a pair of private keys to connect to the API. You can find these keys in the section [your account credentials.](https://www.mercadopago.com.ar/account/credentials).

The **private keys** (also known as  `access_token `) are used for all requests to the APIs, such as processing payments, refunds, etc. The private keys must be kept **confidentially** in your backend servers and should never be published.
