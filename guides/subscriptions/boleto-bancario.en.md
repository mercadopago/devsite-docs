# Boleto banc치rio

It is possible to allow the subscriber to pay the subscription with a boleto banc치rio. When opting for this payment method, the invoice sent will be valid for seven days, and it is going to remain valid until three days after expiration. If the subscriber fails to pay more than two consecutive boletos, the subscription is canceled. 

To offer payment for subscriptions via boleto banc치rio, send a **POST** with the `payment_methods_allowed` parameter informing the payment method that should appear at checkout, for example, `bolbradesco` and the `status` parameter as "pending" to the endpoint [/preapproval_plan](/developers/en/reference/subscriptions/_preapproval_plan/post) and execute the request.

> NOTE
>
> Important
>
> The payment of subscriptions by boleto banc치rio is only available for subscriptions created through the endpoint [/preapproval_plan](/developers/en/reference/subscriptions/_preapproval_plan/post), where the seller must redirect the buyer to the URL generated in the parameter `init_point`
