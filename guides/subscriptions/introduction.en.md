# Introduction

Subscriptions refer to the purchase of products or services upon recurring (monthly/annual) payment of a predetermined amount.

By integrating the subscriptions, the customer will be able to subscribe to products and services with recurring charges according to the period and payment method selected at the time of purchase.

There are two types of subscriptions available for integration:

* **Subscription with an associated plan:** Used when you need to have the same subscription on different occasions and organize them into identifiable groups. Consider as an example a monthly and yearly subscription to a gym.

* **Subscription with no associated plan:** Used in situations where different subscriptions have different characteristics as they are specific to each payer. For example, a subscription that, according to the options selected by the payer, has its final price changed.

Below we show a diagram that explains the flow of each subscription model:
