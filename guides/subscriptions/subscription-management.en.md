# Subscription management

Through subscription management, it is possible to pause, cancel or reactivate an already created subscription, in addition to making other specific changes within its initial settings.

In the following table, you will find more information about the management possibilities:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
| Search subscription | Allows you to search for subscriptions regardless of their status (active, paused, canceled). To do so, send a GET with the necessary parameters to the [/preapproval/search](/developers/en/reference/subscriptions/_preapproval_search/get) endpoint and execute the request.|
| Change amount | This option lets you change the amount of an existing subscription. Send the new amount via `auto_recurring.transaction_amount` and `auto_recurring.currency_id` in a PUT request to the [/preapproval/{id}](/developers/en/reference/subscriptions/_preapproval_plan_id/put) endpoint. |
| Change card of the main payment method | Allows you to change the card linked to an existing subscription. Send a PUT request with the new token in attribute `card_token_id` to the [/preapproval/{id} endpoint](/developers/en/reference/subscriptions/_preapproval_plan_id/put). |
| Change the secondary payment method | Allows you to add a second payment method to an existing subscription. Send a PUT to the [/preapproval/{id}](/developers/en/reference/subscriptions/_preapproval_plan_id/put) endpoint with `card_token_id_secondary` and `payment_method_id_secondary` if the secondary payment method is a card, and only send `payment_method_id_secondary` for any other payment method. |
| Cancel or pause subscription | Allows you to cancel or pause an existing subscription. To cancel a subscription, send a PUT with the `status` attribute and the `canceled` value to the [/preapproval/{id}](/developers/en/reference/subscriptions/_preapproval_id/put) endpoint and execute the request. To pause a subscription, send a PUT with the `status` attribute and the `paused` value to the [/preapproval/{id}](/developers/en/reference/subscriptions/_preapproval_id/put) endpoint and execute the request. |
| Reactivate subscription | It allows you to reactivate a paused subscription and set a deadline for its completion. To do this, send a PUT request with the necessary parameters to the endpoint [/preapproval/{id}](/developers/en/reference/subscriptions/_preapproval_id/put) and execute the request.|
| Change billing date | For subscriptions with a monthly payment frequency, you can choose a fixed day of the month for billing to occur. To do so, send a PUT with the necessary parameters to the [/preapproval/{id}](/developers/pt/reference/subscriptions/_preapproval_id/put) endpoint and execute the request. |
| Set pro rata | You can set a prorated amount for billing an individual subscription. To do so, send a PUT with the necessary parameters to the [/preapproval/{id}](/developers/pt/reference/subscriptions/_preapproval_id/put) endpoint and execute the request. |
| Offer free trial | It is possible to offer a free trial period for customers to test the product and service before purchasing it. To do so, send a PUT with the `free_trial`, `frequency`, and `frequency_type` parameters setting the number and the type of measure (days/months) to the [/preapproval_plan/{id}](/developers/en/reference/subscriptions/_preapproval_plan_id/put) endpoint and execute the request. |
