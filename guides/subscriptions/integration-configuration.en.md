# Integration configuration

To get started, choose the Subscription integration model:

### Subscriptions with an associated plan

Subscriptions with an associated plan are used when it is necessary to use the same subscription on different occasions to organize them into identifiable groups. For example, for a monthly and yearly subscription to a gym.

[Integrate Subscriptions with an associated plan](/developers/en/docs/subscriptions/integration-configuration/subscriptions-associated-plan)

### Subscriptions without

Subscriptions with no associated plan are when different subscriptions have different characteristics because they are specific to each payer. For instance, a single-month subscription with a unique discount.
