# Response Messages

Offer your customers clear and accurate information about the outcome of the operation. This allows them to be notified about what action they can take to resolve it or if there are any additional steps they need to take.

For example, if the used card cannot be validated, you can recommend that they verify if the entered data is correct or use another payment method to complete the operation. For more information about possible errors, refer to the API response reference.

Here is a table with suggested messages based on the status of each operation:

| Status | Scenario | Suggested Message |
|---|---|---|
| APPROVED | Scenarios when the card is valid | Your card has been validated. |
| REJECTED | Scenarios when the card is not valid | Your card could not be validated. |
