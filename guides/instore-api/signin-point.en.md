> This step is only necessary for integrating Point devices.

To log in to your Point device, access the Mercado Pago app on your mobile with your username and password.

Then, still from the Mercado Pago app on your mobile, scan the QR code displayed on your Point's screen.

Follow the step-by-step instructions provided in the Mercado Pago app and complete the requested information:
* **Business name:** enter the store's name.
* **Name for summaries:** indicate how you want the store to appear in the summaries of customer purchases.
* **Category:** the app will allow you to choose the category to which the business belongs from a series of options.
* **Business type:** inform whether the store is a physical store or not.

Once you have completed this information, and depending on whether you have more than one point of sale created, the device will show you a selector. There, select the store and point of sale you created in the previous step. This way, you will link your Point device to the new point of sale.
