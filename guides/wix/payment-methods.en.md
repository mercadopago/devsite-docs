# Configure the types of payments

With Mercado Pago in Wix, you can choose to offer payments by redirecting customers to the Mercado Pago site using Checkout Pro. Learn how to set up these payment methods below.

## Payments with Checkout Pro

With Mercado Pago Checkout Pro, **the buyer will be directed from the store to the Mercado Pago site** where they must fill in the requested information and make the payment. This way, the transaction is processed and completed outside of your store environment. At the end of the transaction, the buyer can be returned to your store.

To activate this type of payment, follow the steps below.

1. On your Wix site, go to the settings panel located on the left of the screen and go to **Settings > Accept Payments**.
2. In "Mercado Pago", click the **Manage** button.
3. In the **Payment methods available with Mercado Pago** section, activate the "MercadoPago" option.
