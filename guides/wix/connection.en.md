# Connect and configure Mercado Pago in a Wix store

Connecting and configuring Mercado Pago as a payment method in your Wix store can be done in two simple and quick steps. In the first one, you connect Mercado Pago as a payment method in your Wix store, and in the second one, you configure the connector with your production credentials.

## Connect Mercado Pago

To connect with Mercado Pago as a provider in your Wix store, follow the steps below.

1. In the settings panel of your Wix site, located on the left of the screen, go to **Settings**.
2. Within the Settings screen, click the **Accept Payments** button.
3. Look for the **Mercado Pago** option and click the **Connect** button.


## Connect your production credentials

To finish configuring Mercado Pago as a means of payment, on the plugin configuration page, complete the fields with your [production credentials](/developers/en/docs/wix/additional-content/your-integrations/credentials) and confirm the Connection.

Done! Your integration is set up and you are already offering Mercado Pago as a payment method in your store.
