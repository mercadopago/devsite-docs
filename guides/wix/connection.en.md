## Connection and configuration

Connecting and configuring Mercado Pago as a payment method in your Wix store can be done in two simple and quick steps. In the first one, you connect Mercado Pago as a payment method in your Wix store, and in the second one, you configure the connector with your production credentials.

1. Make the connection as described in [this Wix documentation](https://support.wix.com/en/article/conectando-mercadopago-como-provedor-de-pagamento). You will automatically be redirected to the connector's configuration page.
2. On the configuration page, fill in the fields with your [production credentials](https://www.mercadopago[FAKER][URL][DOMAIN]/developers/en/guides/resources/credentials) (note that the credentials requested by Wix are Client ID and Client Secret) and confirm the connection.

And that's it! Your integration is set up and you are already offering Mercado Pago as a payment method in your store.
