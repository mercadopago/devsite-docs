## Installments and Interest 

Currently, Mercado Pago only offers the option of interest-free installments within the VTEX platform. 

Similarly, you have the option to configure installment payments and interest directly from your Mercado Pago seller account. To do this, follow the steps described below. 

1. Click on the **Set Installments and Interest** button and log in to your Mercado Pago seller account. 
2. Select the **QR Code and online payments** option, enable installment payments, and select the number of installments you want to offer at checkout. The options range from 1 to 12 installments.
