# How to migrate the gateway affiliation version

If you already registered a MercadoPagoV1 gateway affiliation, you should be aware that it will be discontinued soon and **the migration to MercadoPagoV2 will be mandatory** to continue processing payments on VTEX stores.

MercadoPagoV2 will allow you to offer the same payment methods and also cash or financed payments without a card. You will also be able to activate **3DS (3-D Secure)**, a protocol created to protect transactions in online stores by adding an extra layer of identity verification before the final authorization, making your transactions even more secure and increasing the approval rate of your payments.

To perform the migration from MercadoPagoV1 to MercadoPagoV2, follow these steps: 

## 1. Register a MercadoPagoV2 gateway affiliation 

If you already have a MercadoPagoV1 gateway affiliation, you will now need to create a **new MercadoPagoV2 affiliation**. The process is simple and similar to the process you followed when setting up the previous connector. Please pay close attention to the following process and field descriptions:

1. In your VTEX store admin panel, go to **Payments > Suppliers**. 
2. At the top of the screen, click the **New Supplier** button to create a new affiliation. 
3. Look for the **MercadoPagoV2** connector and select it. This will take you to a new screen. 
4. On said screen, choose the **Affiliation Name** within the store. Also, make sure you have disabled the **"Activate test mode"** button. 
5. Then, fill in the corresponding fields: 

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| Application Key  | Refers to your [production credentials](/developers/en/docs/vtex/additional-content/your-integrations/credentials) of Mercado Pago. Complete with your **Public Key**.  |

If you select the **"No"** option, the transaction will be pending for 48 hours or until the payment is made, and the inventory involved in that purchase will be held for the same period of time.
