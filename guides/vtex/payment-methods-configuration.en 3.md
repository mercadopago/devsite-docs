# Payment Methods Configuration 

Mercado Pago allows you to choose which payment methods to offer in VTEX stores through the configuration of our checkouts: 

* ----[mla, mlu, mlc, mlm, mpe, mco]----[Checkout API:](/developers/en/docs/vtex/payments-configuration/checkout-api)------------ ----[mlb]---- [Checkout Transparente:](/developers/es/docs/vtex/payments-configuration/checkout-api)------------ You can offer interest-free installments, ----[mla, mlm, mlb]----installments without a card,------------ debit card payments, ----[mlb]----Boleto BancÃ¡rio or Pix------------, and the entire payment process will be carried out within the store's environment, without the need for redirection to an external page. 

* [Pro Checkout:](/developers/en/docs/vtex/payments-configuration/checkout-pro) The buyer will be redirected from the store to the Mercado Pago website, where the transaction will be processed and completed with any of the previously configured payment methods. After the completion of this transaction, the customer will be redirected back to the VTEX store.
