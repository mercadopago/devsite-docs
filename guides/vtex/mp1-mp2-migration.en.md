# Gateway version migration

The **MercadoPago** and **MercadoPagoV1** affiliations will be discontinued, since they only processed the Credit and Debit Card payment condition. Currently, these same conditions are available in **MercadoPagoV2**.

If you registered a MercadoPagoV1 affiliation, you can **migrate from MercadoPagoV1 to MercadoPagoV2** following these steps:

1. Register a payment gateway affiliated to **MercadoPagoV2**.
2. In the Payment Conditions, change the **Process with affiliation** to the new one you created.
3. Edit this in all the existing conditions in your electronic store.
