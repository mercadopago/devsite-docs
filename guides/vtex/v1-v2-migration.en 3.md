# How to migrate the gateway affiliation version

If you already registered a MercadoPagoV1 gateway affiliation, you should be aware that it will be discontinued soon.

For this reason, you will need to migrate to MercadoPagoV2, where you can offer the same payment methods and also cash or financed payments without a card. 

To perform the migration from MercadoPagoV1 to MercadoPagoV2, follow these steps: 

1. If you haven't done so already, register a MercadoPagoV2 gateway affiliation, following the instructions to [create a gateway affiliation](/developers/en/docs/vtex/integration/create-gateway-affiliation-v2). 
2. Go to **Payment Conditions** and in the **Affiliation Process**, change MercadoPagoV1 to MercadoPagoV2. 

> WARNING

> Important 
> 
> Since the configuration of payment methods within the platform is done individually, you will need to **perform the migration to MercadoPagoV2 for each configured payment method**.
