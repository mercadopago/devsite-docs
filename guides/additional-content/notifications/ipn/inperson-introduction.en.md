# Introduction

We currently only offer IPN for in person payments using QR.

If you are integrating in person payments with QR code, below we will provide information about IPN notifications in this type of payment. In addition, we will indicate how to consult the order with the external reference and what you will need to do if the customer scans the QR code twice (leaving an order always open).
