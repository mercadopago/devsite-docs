## Notifications

### Webhook

Webhook, also known as "web callback," is an efficient method to receive real-time information whenever an event occurs in an application or system. This approach allows the passive transfer of data between two systems through HTTP POST requests. Regarding reports used in reconciliation, a notification is sent to the user who has configured this service as soon as the corresponding files are generated.

| Attribute        | Description                         |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------|
| transaction_id  | Transaction ID                   |
| request_date    | Request date                     |
| generation_date | Creation date                    |
| files           | Available files                  |
| type            | File format                      |
| url             | Download link                    |
| name            | File name                        |
| status          | Report status                    |
| creation_type   | Manual or scheduled creation      |
| report_type     | Report type                      |
| is_test         | Determines if it is a test        |
| signature       | Webhook notification digital signature |

### Encryption password

The encryption password is essential to secure the notification process to the system. In the message body (_payload_), an attribute called **_"signature"_** is sent to validate the legitimate origin of the Mercado Pago Webhook notification, avoiding possible imitations.

The creation of the **signature** occurs by combining the `transaction_id` with the `encrypted password` in the **_"Webhook Notification"_** section, along with the `generation_date` of the report. These values are then encrypted using the **_BCrypt_** algorithm as follows:

`signature = BCrypt(transaction_id + '-' + password_for_encryption + '-' + generation_date)`

To validate that it is Mercado Pago who issued the notification, the **_verification function_** offered by the **_BCrypt_** algorithm for the desired language must be used.

**Java example:**

`BCrypt.checkpw(transaction_id + '-' + password_for_encryption + '-' + generation_date, payload_signature)`
