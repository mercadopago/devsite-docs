1. From your Mercado Pago account, click [Sales and billing](https://www.mercadopago[FAKER][URL][DOMAIN]/balance/reports) in the left menu.
2. Select the option **Sales and account statement reports > [Releases](https://www.mercadopago[FAKER][URL][DOMAIN]/balance/reports/release)** and click **Generate report**.
3. Search for transactions by time period and select the ones you want to reconcile.
4. Click **Generate**. The report will be _In preparation_, and you will receive an email when it's ready.
