# What is the Available Balance report?


The Available Balance report is a **downloadable report that allows you to know the liquidity of your business**, that is, how much money you have to use. It contains the **detail of the released payments** that are ready to withdraw to a bank account, invest in Mercado Pago or use as balance in the Mercado Pago prepaid card.

> WARNING
>
> The Available Balance report will be disabled from March 1st, 2022.
>
> You can use the [Releases report](https://www.mercadopago[FAKER][URL][DOMAIN]/developers/en/guides/additional-content/reports/released-money/introduction) to reconcile the transactions that affect the balance available in your account, including your bank withdrawals.

## How do I download the report?

Keep in mind that the report generation takes a few minutes depending on how much information you want it to include. It will not always be ready instantly and, until it is, you will see the status *In preparation* on the screen.

Once available, it will be in your report tray and you can always download it two ways:

* From the download link weâ€™ll email you.
* From your Mercado Pago account, go to [your reports](https://www.mercadopago.com/balance/reports/settlement-report) and select the *Available Balance report* option.

## Report Values

Depending on the [rates and terms](https://www.mercadopago.com.ar/settings/release-options) you choose, the money you earn from an order will be released some time after the payment is credited. For this reason, the total value you see in the report will not always match your total balance or the value you see in the billing reports.

The release periods have to do with the bank terms or the intermediation flows when the operations are carried out in Mercado Libre. Other operations that may affect the release of your money are Chargebacks and Complaints that you may receive for an order.


> To know the exact date on which the money of an operation will be available, check the [details of your accredited collections](https://www.mercadopago.com.ar/activities/balance).


## What to use the report for
