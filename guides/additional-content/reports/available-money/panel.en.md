# Generation by the Mercado Pago panel

Generate your Available Balance reports from your Mercado Pago panel. You can schedule the generation of an Available Balance report for each time you make a withdrawal from your balance to a bank account.

Follow these steps to generate your reports:

1. From your Mercado Pago account, go to [your reports](https://www.mercadopago.com.ar/balance/reports) and select the *Reports* option.
1. Go to Available Money reports and click on *Create report*.
1. Search for withdrawals by **time period** and select the withdrawal you want to reconcile.

Done! You will see your report *In preparation*.

You can also schedule the generation of these reports [for each money withdrawal](https://www.mercadopago[FAKER][URL][DOMAIN]/developers/en/guides/additional-content/reports/available-money/withdrawal).
