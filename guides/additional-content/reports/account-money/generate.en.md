## Technical characteristics of the report

Consider the following technical information when you want to generate, schedule and set up your reports.

| Element | Characteristics |
| --- | --- |
| Schedule | <br/>- Daily<br/> - Weekly<br/>- Monthly<br/><br/> |

### Report Structure

Know the characteristics of the elements that make up your report.

| Element or Action | Characteristics |
| --- | --- |
| Tables Detail | <br/>The detail of the tables includes information generated in at least 1 day.<br/> <br/> |
| Column Order |<br/> Permanent. <br/> <br/> |

| Download formats | <br/>.csv, .xlsx <br/><br/>Tip: Download the report in .csv to import the data and use it in other applications. Download it in .xlsx to read the information in the spreadsheet tables. <br/><br/> |
| File | <br/>The generated reports are saved in your Mercado Pago account.<br/><br/> |
| Set up available via API | <br/>- Columns to generate per report.<br/> - File prefix for easy identification.<br/> - SFTP upload.<br/> - Column separator (period or semicolon).<br/> - Email notification.<br/><br/> |

## Notifications

### Webhook

Webhook (also known as "web callback") is a simple method that allows an application or system to send real-time data whenever a particular event takes place, that is, it is a way to passively receive information between two systems via an HTTP POST. In the case of the reports used for reconciliation, a notification is sent to the user who has set up this service when their files are generated.

| Attribute       | Description                  |
|-----------------|------------------------------|
| transaction_id  | Transaction ID               |
| request_date    | Request date                 |
| generation_date | Generation date              |
| files           | Available files              |
| type            | File format                  |
| url             | Download link                |
| name            | File name                    |
| status          | Report status                |
| creation_type   | Manual or scheduled creation |
| report_type     | Report type                  |
| is_test         | Determines if it is a test   |
| signature       | Notification signature       |

### Password for encryption

To ensure the notification process to the system, an attribute called **_signature_** will be sent in the body of the message (payload) in order to validate that the Webhook notification originated from Mercado Pago and that it is not an imitation.

The **_signature_** is build up by joining the `transaction_id` with the `password for encryption` configured in the **_"Webhook Notification"_** section, plus the `generation_date` of the report. Once the values are joined, they are encrypted using the **_BCrypt_** algorithm as follows:

`signature = BCrypt(transaction_id + '-' + password_for_encryption + '-' + generation_date)`

To validate that it is Mercado Pago who issued the notification, the **_verification function_** offered by the **_BCrypt_** algorithm for the desired language must be used.

**Java example:**

`BCrypt.checkpw(transaction_id + '-' + password_for_encryption + '-' + generation_date, payload_signature)`
