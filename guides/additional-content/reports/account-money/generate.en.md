## Notifications

### Webhook

Webhook (also known as "web callback") is a simple method that allows an application or system to send real-time data whenever a particular event takes place, that is, it is a way to passively receive information between two systems via an HTTP POST. In the case of the reports used for reconciliation, a notification is sent to the user who has set up this service when their files are generated.

| Attribute       | Description                  |
|-----------------|------------------------------|
| transaction_id  | Transaction ID               |
| request_date    | Request date                 |
| generation_date | Generation date              |
| files           | Available files              |
| type            | File format                  |
| url             | Download link                |
| name            | File name                    |
| status          | Report status                |
| creation_type   | Manual or scheduled creation |
| report_type     | Report type                  |
| is_test         | Determines if it is a test   |
| signature       | Notification signature       |

### Password for encryption

The encryption password is essential to secure the notification process to the system. In the message body (_payload_), an attribute called **_"signature"_** is sent to validate the legitimate origin of the Mercado Pago Webhook notification, avoiding possible imitations.

The creation of the **signature** occurs by combining the `transaction_id` with the `encrypted password` in the **_"Webhook Notification"_** section, along with the `generation_date` of the report. These values are then encrypted using the **_BCrypt_** algorithm as follows:

`signature = BCrypt(transaction_id + '-' + password_for_encryption + '-' + generation_date)`

To validate that it is Mercado Pago who issued the notification, the **_verification function_** offered by the **_BCrypt_** algorithm for the desired language must be used.

**Java example:**

`BCrypt.checkpw(transaction_id + '-' + password_for_encryption + '-' + generation_date, payload_signature)`
