# How to use the report?

Once the report is ready and downloaded, you will have a file to review the spreadsheets or import into the reconciliation program you use.

To review the report we recommend downloading it in .csv format to open it in the program that you view it. Configure your program to support the UTF-8 format, so you avoid reading problems.

## What does the report contain?

The report is made up of different types of transactions that you can see in the `TRANSACTION_TYPE` column. Each of them will have the gross amount of the operation.

| Transactions | Transaction type |
| --- | --- |
| *SETTLEMENT* |<br/> Approved <br/><br/>|
| *REFUND* |----[mla, mlm, mco, mlu, mlb, mlc]---- <br/> Total or partial returns <br/><br/> ------------ ----[mpe]---- <br/> Total returns <br/><br/> ------------|
| *CHARGEBACK* | <br/> Chargeback <br/><br/> |
| *DISPUTE* |<br/> In a complaint <br/><br/>|
| *WITHDRAWAL* | <br/> Money withdrawn <br/><br/>|
| *CASHBACK* | <br/> Cashback <br/><br/> |
| *SETTLEMENT_SHIPPING* | <br/> Approved shipments <br/><br/> |
| *REFUND_SHIPPING* | ----[mla, mlm, mco, mlu, mlb, mlc]---- <br/> Total or partial returns of shipping costs <br/><br/> ------------ ----[mpe]---- Returns of shipping costs ------------ |
| *CHARGEBACK_SHIPPING* | <br/> Shipping chargeback <br/><br/> |
| *DISPUTE_SHIPPING* | <br/> The shipment is in claim <br/><br/> |

And in the `SETTLEMENT_NET_AMOUNT` column you will find the real impact on your account balance.
