# Improve the approval process

## Why is a payment order rejected?

A payment can be rejected due to an error with a payment method or non-compliance with security requirements. I.e, if a card lacks enough funds, a data fails to upload properly or unusual account movements are detected.

In order to avoid any revenue loss with your business and to enhance your customers experience, we work with agents from each payment method and operate with the latest tools for fraud prevention and payment growth.

## Bank rejected payments

When offering debit and credit card, the issuer can reject the charge due to several reasons. For instance, card may be expired, lack enough funds or have incorrect data.

You can see the payment status in the API response as `rejected` and the reason for rejection in `status_detail`.

```json
{
    "status": "rejected",
    "status_detail": "cc_rejected_insufficient_amount",
    "id": 47198050,
    "payment_method_id": "master",
    "payment_type_id": "credit_card",
    ...
}
```

Also, you can find more information about payment details on [Mercado Pago activity section](https://www.mercadopago.com.ar/), where payments are being received.

> WARNING
>
> Rejection without reason
>
>Keep in mind that if the card issuer fails to inform the rejection reason, you’ll see the payment details as `cc_rejected_other_reason`. In this scenario, we recommend changing the payment method or reaching out to the bank to solve the issue.

## Payments rejected due to fraud prevention

We track transactions in real time and perform security validations, to recognize payments that weren’t authorized by the card owner and also to avoid chargebacks.

When our fraud prevention system detects a suspicious payout, you'll be able to see the payment status in the API response as `rejected` and the rejection reason as `cc_rejected_high_risk`.

```json
{
    "status": "rejected",
    "status_detail": "cc_rejected_high_risk",
    "id": 47198050,
    "payment_method_id": "master",
    "payment_type_id": "credit_card",
    ...
}
```

## Tips to improve the approval process

To prevent real payments being rejected by security non-compliance, you must add as much information as you can while performing an operation.

We can help you detect unusual client behaviour with our security code and Device ID, created to prevent fraud. And don’t worry, we take care of your customers data and we won't share it with anyone.

> If you use Checkout Pro or Web Tokenize Checkout, you already implement our security methods to prevent fraud.

### Add our security code into your website

It’s simple. Add the script, adjust the section of your website where you inserted it and that’s it! You’re all set and done. You just need to replace the `view` value for the page name you want.

```html
<script src="https://www.mercadopago.com/v2/security.js" view="home"></script>
```

#### VIEW Values

| Value | Section |
| --- | --- |
| *home* | Your website main page. |
| *search* | Search page or product list page. |
| *item* | Single product page with details for one product. |

> NOTE
>
> Note
>
> In case of unavailable value for a section, left empty.

### Implement the Device ID in your site

To deploy the device on your website, you must add the following code:

```html
<script src="https://www.mercadopago.com/v2/security.js" view="checkout"></script>
```

It’s important to send the `device_id` generated by this code to your server. When creating a payment, add the following header to the request:

```http
X-meli-session-id: device_id
```

#### You can obtain the Device ID in two ways:

- A global javascript variable is automatically created `MP_DEVICE_SESSION_ID` with the value ` device_id`. If you prefer that we assign it to another variable, indicate the name by adding the attribute `output`.

```html
<script src="https://www.mercadopago.com/v2/security.js" view="checkout" output="deviceId"></script>
````

- If you want your own variable, you can add an HTML tag on your site with the identificator `id =" deviceId "` and the code will automatically assign the value `device_id`.

```html
<input type="hidden" id="deviceId">
```

### Implement the Device ID in your native mobile application

If you have a native application, you can capture the device information with our SDK and send it when creating the token. Follow these steps:

#### 1. Add dependency

[[[
```ios
===
Add the following code in the **Podfile** file.
===
use_frameworks!
pod ‘MercadoPagoDevicesSDK’
```
```android
===
You need to add the repository and the dependency in the **build.gradle** file.
===
repositories {
    maven {
        url "https://artifacts.mercadolibre.com/repository/android-releases"
    }
}
dependencies {
   implementation 'com.mercadolibre.android.device:sdk:3.0.5'
}
```
]]]

#### 2. Initialize module

[[[
```swift
===
We recommend initializing it in the _didFinishLaunchingWithOptions_ event of the _AppDelegate_.
===
import MercadoPagoDevicesSDK
...
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
        ...        
        MercadoPagoDevicesSDK.shared.execute()
        ...
}
```
```objective-c
===
We recommend initializing it in the _didFinishLaunchingWithOptions_ event of the _AppDelegate_.
===
@import ‘MercadoPagoDevicesSDK’;
...
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
    ...
    [[MercadoPagoDevicesSDK shared] execute];
    ...
}
```
```java
===
We recommend initializing it in the _MainApplication_ class.
===
import com.mercadolibre.android.device.sdk.DeviceSDK;


DeviceSDK.getInstance().execute(this);
```
]]]

#### 3. Capture information

Execute one of these functions to obtain the information in the format that you prefer.

[[[
```swift
MercadoPagoDevicesSDK.shared.getInfo() // Returns a Codable Device Object
MercadoPagoDevicesSDK.shared.getInfoAsJson() // Returns a JSON Library Data Object
MercadoPagoDevicesSDK.shared.getInfoAsJsonString() // Returns a JSON String
MercadoPagoDevicesSDK.shared.getInfoAsDictionary() // Returns a Dictionary<String,Any>
```
```objective-c
[[[MercadoPagoDevicesSDK] shared] getInfoAsJson] // Returns a JSON Library Data Object
[[[MercadoPagoDevicesSDK] shared] getInfoAsJsonString] // Returns a JSON String
[[[MercadoPagoDevicesSDK] shared] getInfoAsDictionary] // Returns a Dictionary<String,Any>
```
```java
Device device = DeviceSDK.getInstance().getInfo() // Returns a Serializable Device Object
Map deviceMap = DeviceSDK.getInstance().getInfoAsMap()  // Returns a Map<String, Object>
String jsonString = DeviceSDK.getInstance().getInfoAsJsonString() // Returns a JSON String
```
]]]

#### 4. Send information

Finally, send the information in the `device` field when creating the `card_token`.

```
{
    ...,
     "device":{
      "fingerprint":{
         "os":"iOS",
         "system_version":"8.3",
         "ram":18446744071562067968,
         "disk_space":498876809216,
         "model":"MacBookPro9,2",
         "free_disk_space":328918237184,

            },
            {
               "name":"uuid",
               "value":"AB28738B-8DC2-4EC2-B514-3ACF330482B6"
            }
         ],
         "vendor_specific_attributes":{
            "feature_flash":false,
            "can_make_phone_calls":false,
            "can_send_sms":false,
            "video_camera_available":true,
            "cpu_count":4,
            "simulator":true,
            "device_languaje":"en",
            "device_idiom":"Phone",
            "platform":"x86_64",
            "device_name":"iPhone Simulator",
            "device_family":4,
            "retina_display_capable":true,
            "feature_camera":false,
            "device_model":"iPhone Simulator",
            "feature_front_camera":false
         },
         "resolution":"375x667"
      }
}
```

### Include all payment information

In order to optimize payment security validation and avoid rejected payments, you can send us the customer and item data so we can analyze it. I.e., if you send us this information, we can detect if the buyer has made suspicious payments in the past.

### Help your clients with their rejected payments

It’s important to explain to your clients the reason for a payment rejection and how to fix it. Your customers will have all the information they need to be able to pay you without problems.

For instance, if a payment is rejected due to lack of funds, you can recommend trying again with a different payment method.
