# Requirements to go to production

When you have your integration ready and want to start receiving payments, you must [activate your credentials](/developers/en/guides/additional-content/your-integrations/credentials) for production and replace the test credentials if needed. 

Also, we recommend the following additional considerations.

## Homologation

Before going to production, and to provide the best experience for both sellers and buyers,you must test your [integrationâ€™s quality](/developers/en/guides/additional-content/homologator/homologator) with our homologation tool. This will allow you to certify that your integration meets the necessary quality and security requirements. 

## SSL Certificate

To ensure the security of your integration and protect the data involved in transactions, **it is necessary that you have an SSL certificate and that the payment form be made available on an HTTPS page**. 

This process aims to guarantee the security of your customer's data, comply with legal requirements in each country, and provide the best purchasing experience for your sales.

Although an SSL certificate may not be required during the testing phase, it is mandatory when going live. For more information, [check the Terms and Conditions of Mercado Pago](/developers/en/guides/resources/legal/terms-and-conditions).

## Payment approval

Get to know what measures you can take to improve your [payment approval](/developers/en/guides/additional-content/how-tos/payment-rejections), such as submitting the item and payer information, shipping data, and industry information, among others.

## Notifications

Keep the status of orders updated in your systems by using and processing notifications correctly [IPN](/developers/en/guides/additional-content/your-integrations/ipn) or [Webhooks](/developers/en/guides/additional-content/your-integrations/webhooks).

## Reports

[Mercado Pago reports](/developers/en/guides/additional-content/reports/introduction) provide financial information to track account transactions, such as available balance, movements, and liquidity. This facilitates the reconciliation of sales and other operations with your internal management systems.

We recommend using the reports to improve your company's financial management once you go live.
