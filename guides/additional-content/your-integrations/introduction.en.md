# Your integrations

Your Integrations is your integration management environment automatically created with a user ID (the Mercado Pago ID) when you open an account on Mercado Pago. In it, you can create a new application in the [Developer Dashboard](/developers/panel/app) or access the [Application details](/developers/en/guides/additional-content/your-integrations/application-details) page for each listed application, as well as request access to credentials for an application you don't manage.

## Application details

The [Application details](/developers/en/guides/additional-content/your-integrations/application-details) page consists of different sections, each with a different purpose.
* **General Information**: displays general information about the application.
* **Testing**: test the integration's functionality, perform tests, and simulate different transactions with [Credentials](/developers/en/guides/additional-content/your-integrations/credentials), [Test accounts](/developers/en/guides/additional-content/your-integrations/test-accounts), and [Test cards](/developers/en/guides/additional-content/your-integrations/test-cards).
* **Notifications**: configure the application to receive notifications for transaction-related events, such as payment alerts, fraud notifications, disputes, etc. There are two types of notifications available for configuration:
    1. [Webhooks](/developers/en/guides/additional-content/your-integrations/webhooks)
    2. [IPN](/developers/en/guides/additional-content/your-integrations/ipn)
* **Production**: activate **Production Credentials** to start receiving payments in your online store and other applications.
* **Evaluation**: Validate your integration to ensure that your development meets the necessary quality and security requirements to provide both the seller and the buyer with the best experience with Mercado Pago.
