# Ease of conversion

To make the payment process simple and fast for your users, and thus achieve more conversions, your checkout must be easy to navigate and consistent. Follow these tips to achieve it.

## Provide clear steps

We recommend building a multi-step experience where each step focuses on a different action, especially when it comes to experience in mobile devices. This way, users can focus their attention and it is easier for them to find what they are looking for without having to scroll too much. 

For **mobile**, choose short steps that focus attention and are easy to navigate. Instead, for **desktop**, you can use one step experiences since the user has more extensive control over their actions and it is easier to find what they are looking for.

## Offer consistency

**Consistency** is a key aspect to provide coherence. If all the components or content of your checkout followed a different logic, users would not know how to act on them at each step. It helps us to establish patterns that users understand and remember. Try to be consistent both visually and textually.
