# Best practices for your credentials

To ensure that your integrations are always secure, we have created a guide to best practices that will help you protect your data and that of the accounts you manage to always keep them safe.

Your integrations handle sensitive information and, therefore, it is necessary that you apply certain practices that guarantee the security of your data and your clientsâ€™ data.

At Mercado Pago we ensure the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of all our processes by following the best market practices so that you can use all our products safely. You can learn more about these practices by reading the [OWASP](/developers/en/guides/additional-content/security/owasp) and [PCI DSS](/developers/en/guides/additional-content/security/pci).

In this guide we will show you what the best practices that you can carry out are, so that your integrations are secure from end to end, at all times.
