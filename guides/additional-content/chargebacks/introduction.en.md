# How to manage and prevent chargebacks

This documentation will provide all the necessary information for managing and preventing chargebacks.

## What is a chargeback?

A chargeback is generated when a **customer does not recognize the charge on their debit or credit card.**

When this happens, the amount paid is withheld until the problem is resolved with the card-issuing institution.
