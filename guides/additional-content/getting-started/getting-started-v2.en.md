# How to start integrating

If you're not sure where to start based on your programming knowledge, don't worry. We have different solutions that fit your needs. Follow the diagram below to find out which product is right for you.

![Getting started](/images/getting-started/getting-started-diagram2-en.png)

For details on the **accepted payment methods in each country**, consult the complete list of [available payment methods](/developers/en/docs/sales-processing/payment-methods).

 - type: reverse
 - message: Credentials are unique passwords used to identify an integration in your account. They play a fundamental role in securely capturing payments in online stores and other applications.
 - image: /getting-started/woman-male-dev.png
---

You can find the credentials in **Application details > Credentials** within [Your integrations](/developers/panel/app).

There are two different types of credentials: **test credentials** and **production credentials**. Both types of credentials consist of two pairs of keys that you must use depending on the chosen product: **Public Key** and **Access Token** or **Client ID** and **Client secret**.

If you need to share your credentials, you can do so securely. On the Mercado Pago site, navigate to [Your business > Settings > Management and administration > Credentials](https://www.mercadopago[FAKE][URL][DOMAIN]/settings/account/credentials) and select the **Share credentials** option.

To learn more, access the [credentials documentation](/developers/en/docs/your-integrations/credentials).
