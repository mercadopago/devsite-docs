 - message: Credentials are unique passwords used to identify an integration in your account. They play a fundamental role in securely capturing payments in online stores and other applications.

---

You can find the credentials in **Application details > Credentials** within [Your integrations](/developers/panel/app).

There are two different types of credentials: **test credentials** and **production credentials**. Both types of credentials consist of two pairs of keys that you must use depending on the chosen product: **Public Key** and **Access Token** or **Client ID** and **Client secret**.

If you need to share your credentials, you can do so securely. On the Mercado Pago site, navigate to [Your business > Settings > Management and administration > Credentials](https://www.mercadopago[FAKE][URL][DOMAIN]/settings/account/credentials) and select the **Share credentials** option.

> To learn more, access the [credentials documentation](/developers/en/docs/your-integrations/credentials).
