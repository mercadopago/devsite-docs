# Your certifications
 
This area displays the certificates of completion and the badges obtained after passing the certification exam chosen in the **&lt;dev&gt;program**, the benefits program for developers at Mercado Pago.
 
The **certificates** can be downloaded to your computer's local files, in addition to having different colors for each certification and an authentication QR Code. The file can also be shared on social networks and there will be the possibility of creating a public sharing link.
 
The **badges** act as a way to identify developers who have already completed our official certification process and, like the certificates, have different colors for each type of certification. They can also be downloaded to your computer's local files and added to a professional profile through HTML, for example.
 
Check the [&lt;dev&gt;program](/developers/en/developer-program) page for more information.

## Integrator ID
 
Unique number that identifies you as a member of the **&lt;dev&gt;program** automatically generated after your first successful certification. It is located next to your Mercado Pago ID (user ID) and only appears after it has been generated.
 
The **&lt;dev&gt;program** is a program from Mercado Pago for developers who integrate our checkout solutions. The developer takes a free online certification test, and if approved, gains access to exclusive benefits.
 
Check out the [&lt;dev&gt;program](/developers/en/developer-program) page and choose which product you want to earn your certification for. Then, use your integrator ID and enter it into your integrations to receive extra benefits.

In [Your certifications](/developers/panel/developer-program), click on **Learn more** to obtain detailed information about the certification process for each product.
