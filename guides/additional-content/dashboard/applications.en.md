# Your applications
 
Applications are the different integrations contained in one or more stores. You can create an application for each solution you implement, in order to have everything organized and maintain control that makes management easier.
 
Each application has a set of credentials and the possibility to configure its own notifications. Each card represents a created application and displays the **name**, the **description**, the **application ID** and a **button that allows managing the application**.

> By default the screen displays only 3 created applications. To view the other applications, click on **See all applications**.
 
## Create new application
 
To create an application, follow the steps below:
 
1. Select "Creat new application" or "Create your first application".
2. Name your application (limit of 50 characters).
3. Choose a solution to be integrated.
   * **Online payments**. If you are using an e-commerce platform, select the **platform** you are going to use to integrate. If not, select the **Mercado Pago product** being integrated.
   * **In person payments**. Select the **Mercado Pago product** being integrated.
4. Accept our Terms and Conditions.
5. Create the application by clicking on the button "Create application".
 
For every application created, a new card containing the application's name, description and ID is automatically created on the [Dashboard](https://www.mercadopago[FAKER][URL][DOMAIN]/developers/panel) homepage.
