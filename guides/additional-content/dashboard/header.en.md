# Header
 
The header contains your identification as an member user of Mercado Pago. Your ID is made up of two IDs.
 
## User ID
 
Identification number (Mercado Pago ID) generated automatically when creating the Mercado Pago account. The ID that identifies the Mercado Pago user is a unique number.
 
## Integrator ID
 
Unique number that identifies you as a member of the **&lt;dev&gt;program** automatically generated after your first successful certification. It is located next to your Mercado Pago ID (user ID) and only appears after it has been generated.
 
The **&lt;dev&gt;program** is a free and exclusive developer program designed for you to join our community and receive extra benefits. To be a part of it, you must have some of the official Mercado Pago certifications.
 
Check out the [&lt;dev&gt;program](https://www.mercadopago[FAKER][URL][DOMAIN]/developers/en/developer-program) page and choose which product you want to earn your certification for. Then, use your integrator ID and enter it into your integrations to receive extra benefits.
