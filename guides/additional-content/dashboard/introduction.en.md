# Dashboard
 
The [Dashboard](https://mercadopago[FAKER][URL][DOMAIN]/developers/panel/app) is your integration management environment automatically created with a user ID for you when you open a Mercado Pago account. In it you can create, edit and delete applications.
 
The Dashboard is made up of different sections, each with a different purpose.
 
* **Header**: summary of your personal information as an integrator of Mercado Pago.
* **Your applications**: displays your created applications and allows you to create new ones.
* **Accounts you integrate**: information regarding third-party accounts that you have been given permission to use.
* **Your certifications**: information about your certifications in our certified developer program (**&lt;dev&gt;program**).
