# Configure the integration with cards

To configure Payment Brick integration to receive payments with credit and debit cards you need to follow the steps below.

1. [Create container](#bookmark_create_container)
2. [Include and configure MercadoPago.js library](#bookmark_include_and_configure_mercadopago.js_library)
3. [Instantiate brick](#bookmark_instantiate_brick)
4. [Render brick](#bookmark_render_brick)
5. [Manage credit and debit cards](#bookmark_manage_credit_and_debit_cards)
6. [Include saved cards](#bookmark_include_saved_cards)

> The steps are performed on the backend or frontend. The **Client-Side** and **Server-Side** pills located immediately next to the title help you to identify which step is performed in which instance. <br/></br>
> <br/></br>
> And, to help, we have prepared a complete [code example](/developers/en/docs/checkout-bricks/payment-brick/code-example-cards) that you can use as a template.

> Create container

You will need to create a container to define where the brick will be placed on the screen. The creation of the container is done by inserting an element (for example, a div) in the HTML code of the page where the brick will be rendered (see the code below).

> NOTE
> 
> Attention

> The value shown in the `id` property below is just an example and can be altered, however, it should always match the `id` indicated in the render.

```html
  <div id="paymentBrick_container"></div>
```

> CLIENT_SIDE

> h2

> Include and configure MercadoPago.js library

**Use our official library to access Mercado Pago features** from your frontend securely.

> NOTE
>
> Attention
>
> JS code can be included in a `< script >` tag or a separate JS file.

You will need to install the SDK by adding the following in your HTML code:

```html
<script src="https://sdk.mercadopago.com/js/v2"></script>
```

Next, initialize the SDK by setting your [public key](/developers/en/guides/additional-content/credentials/credentials)using JavaScript code as follows:

```javascript
const mp = new MercadoPago('YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY');
```

> CLIENT_SIDE
>
> h2
>
> Instantiate brick

With the container created and our SDK JS installed, the next step is to instantiate the brick builder, which will allow generating the brick. To create the brick instance, insert the code below after the previous step.

```javascript
const bricksBuilder = mp.bricks();
```

> WARNING

> Attention
>
> During brick instantiation, different errors may appear. For more details on each of them, see the [Possible Errors](/developers/en/docs/checkout-bricks/additional-content/possible-errors) section.

> CLIENT_SIDE
>
> h2
>
> Render brick

Once instantiated, the brick can be rendered and have all its configurations compiled so that the final structure of the brick is generated.

To render the brick, insert the following code after the previous step and fill in the attributes according to the comments highlighted in this same code.

```javascript
const renderPaymentBrick = async (bricksBuilder) => {
 const settings = {
   initialization: {
     amount: 100, // amount of processing to be performed
   },
   customization: {
     paymentMethods: {
       creditCard: 'all',
       debitCard: 'all',
     },
   },
   callbacks: {
     onReady: () => {
       // callback called when Brick is ready
     },
     onSubmit: ({ paymentType, formData }) => {
       // callback called when clicking on the data submission button
      
       if (paymentType === 'credit_card' || paymentType === 'debit_card') {
         return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
           fetch("/processar-pago", {
             method: "POST",
             headers: {
               "Content-Type": "application/json",
             },
             body: JSON.stringify(formData)
           })
             .then((response) => {
               // receive payment result
               resolve();
             })
             .catch((error) => {
               // handle error response when trying to create payment
               reject();
             })
         });
       }
     },
     onError: (error) => {
       // callback called for all Brick error cases
     },
   },
 };
 window.paymentBrickController = await bricksBuilder.create(
   'payment',
   'paymentBrick_container',
   settings
 );
};
renderPaymentBrick(bricksBuilder);
```

The result of rendering the brick should be like the image below:”

> WARNING
>
> Attention
>
> For an effective Brick control, the function submitted in `onSubmit` must always return a Promise. You should call `resolve()` only if your backend processes was successful. Call `reject()` if an error occurs. The `reject()` will make the brick allow the fields to be filled in again and a new payment attempt possible. Also, when calling the `resolve()` method inside the `onSubmit` Promise, the brick does not allow new payments. If you want to make a new payment, you must create a new Brick instance.

> Manage credit and debit cards

The code snippet responsible for including the credit and debit card as a means of payment is as follows:

```Javascript
settings = {
  ...,
  customization: {
    ...,
    paymentMethods: {
      ...,
      creditCard: 'all',
      debitCard: 'all'
    }
  }
}
```

The `creditCard` and `debitCard` properties accept 2 types of variables, `string` and `string[]`. In the example above, payments with credit and debit cards of any brand accepted by Mercado Pago will be accepted.

If you want to select the flags, instead of the string `all`, you can pass an array with just the desired IDs. As in the example below, where only **MASTER** and **VISA** credit cards and **ELO** debit cards will be accepted.

```Javascript
settings = {
  ...,
  customization: {
    ...,
    paymentMethods: {
      ...,
      creditCard: [ 'master', 'visa' ],
      debitCard: [ 'debelo' ]
    }
  }
}
```

For a complete list of IDs that can be passed within the array, check the [Get Payment Methods](/developers/en/reference/payment_methods/_payment_methods/get) API in our API Reference.

> NOTE
>
> Important
>
> The API response contains IDs of several `payment_type_id`. IDs accepted by the `creditCard` property are only those that contain `payment_type_id = 'credit_card'` and the IDs accepted by the `debitCard` property are only those that contain `payment_type_id = 'debit_card'`.

## Include saved cards

In Payment Brick you can make saved cards available to your customers. To learn how to add saved cards, see the section [Include saved cards](/developers/en/docs/checkout-bricks/payment-brick/additional-customization/customers-cards).
