# Configure the integration with other payment methods

With Mercado Pago's Checkout Bricks, it is possible to offer, in addition to card and Pix, payments via **boleto bancário** and **payment in lottery**. To offer **boleto bancário** and payment in **lottery**, follow the steps below. 

> If you have already integrated card payments, you can start the integration from **step 4**.

1. [Create container](#bookmark_create_container)
2. [Include and configure MercadoPago.js library](#bookmark_include_and_configure_mercadopago.js_library)
3. [Instantiate Brick](#bookmark_instantiate_brick)
4. [Render Brick](#bookmark_render_brick)
5. [Manage other payment methods](#bookmark_manage_other_payment_methods)

> The steps are performed on the backend or frontend. The **Client-Side** and **Server-Side** pills located immediately next to the title help you to identify which step is performed in which instance. <br/></br>
> <br/></br>
> And to help, we've prepared a complete [code-example](/developers/en/docs/checkout-bricks/payment-brick/code-example/other-payment-methods/brasil) of the Payment Brick configuration with **boleto bancário** and payment in **lottery** that you can use as a template.

> Create container

You will need to create a container to define where the Brick will be placed on the screen. The creation of the container is done by inserting an element (for example, a div) in the HTML code of the page where the Brick will be rendered (see the code below).

> NOTE
> 
> Attention

> The value shown in the `id` property below is just an example and can be altered, however, it should always match the `id` indicated in the render.

```html
  <div id="paymentBrick_container"></div>
```

> h2

> Include and configure MercadoPago.js library

**Use our official library to access Mercado Pago features** from your frontend securely.

> NOTE
>
> Attention
>
> JS code can be included in a `< script >` tag or a separate JS file.

You will need to install the SDK by adding the following in your HTML code:

```html
<script src="https://sdk.mercadopago.com/js/v2"></script>
```

Next, initialize the SDK by setting your [public key](/developers/en/guides/additional-content/credentials/credentials)using JavaScript code as follows:

```javascript
const mp = new MercadoPago('YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY');
```

> CLIENT_SIDE
>
> h2
>
> Instantiate Brick

With the container created and our SDK JS installed, the next step is to instantiate the Brick builder, which will allow generating the Brick. To create the Brick instance, insert the code below after the previous step.

```javascript
const bricksBuilder = mp.bricks();
```

> WARNING

> Attention
>
> During Brick instantiation, different errors may appear. For more details on each of them, see the [Possible Errors](/developers/en/docs/checkout-bricks/additional-content/possible-errors) section.

> Render Brick

Once instantiated, the Brick can be rendered and have all its configurations compiled so that the final structure of the Brick is generated.

To render the Brick, insert the following code after the previous step and fill in the attributes according to the comments highlighted in this same code.

```javascript
const renderPaymentBrick = async (bricksBuilder) => {
 const settings = {
   initialization: {
     amount: 100, // total amount to be paid
   },
   customization: {
     paymentMethods: {
       ticket: 'all',
     },
   },
   callbacks: {
     onReady: () => {
       /*
         Callback called when Brick is ready
         Here you can hide loadings from your site, for example.
       */
     },
     onSubmit: ({ selectedPaymentMethod, formData }) => {
       // callback called when clicking on the data submission button
      
         return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
           fetch("/processar-pago", {
             method: "POST",
             headers: {
               "Content-Type": "application/json",
             },
             body: JSON.stringify(formData)
           })
             .then((response) => {
               // receive payment result
               resolve();
             })
             .catch((error) => {
               // handle error response when trying to create payment
               reject();
             })
         });
       
     },
     onError: (error) => {
       // callback called for all Brick error cases
       console.error(error);
     },
   },
 };
 window.paymentBrickController = await bricksBuilder.create(
   'payment',
   'paymentBrick_container',
   settings
 );
};
renderPaymentBrick(bricksBuilder);  
```

The result of rendering the Brick should be like the image below:”

> WARNING
>
> Attention
>
> For an effective Brick control, the function submitted in `onSubmit` must always return a Promise. You should call `resolve()` only if your backend processes was successful. Call `reject()` if an error occurs. The `reject()` will make the Brick allow the fields to be filled in again and a new payment attempt possible. Also, when calling the `resolve()` method inside the `onSubmit` Promise, the Brick does not allow new payments. If you want to make a new payment, you must create a new Brick instance.

> The payment methods described below require the buyer's address, name and document details to be filled in. For a better user experience, it is recommended that the integrator already initializes this data, so it will not be necessary to fill it manually. [Check here](/developers/en/docs/checkout-bricks/payment-brick/additional-customization/initialize-data-on-the-bricks) how to initialize the Brick with this data already filled in.

To include payments via **boleto bancário** and **payment in lottery**, just use the following configuration:

[[[
```Javascript
settings = {
  ...,
  customization: {
    ...,
    paymentMethods: {
      ...,
      ticket: 'all'
    }
  }
}
```
]]]

The `ticket` property accepts 2 variable types, `string` and `string[]`. In the example above, payments via **boleto bancário** and **payment in lottery** will be accepted. 

If you don't want to allow both payment methods, instead of the string `all`, you can pass an array with just the desired IDs. As in the example below, where only payment via **boleto** is accepted.

[[[
```Javascript
settings = {
  ...,
  customization: {
    ...,
    paymentMethods: {
      ...,
      ticket: [ 'bolbradesco' ]
    }
  }
}
```
]]]

If you want a complete list of IDs that can be passed within the array, check the [Get Payment Methods](/developers/en/reference/payment_methods/_payment_methods/get) API in our API Reference. For more information, check out the [corresponding section](/developers/en/docs/checkout-bricks/additional-content/consult-payment-methods).

> NOTE
>
> Important
>
> The API response contains IDs of several `payment_type_id`. IDs accepted by the `ticket` property are only those that contain `payment_type_id = 'ticket'`.
