## Configure the integration with seller user data

Configure your **seller test user's** [productive public key]([FAKER][CREDENTIALS][URL]) at your application frontend, and the **buyer test user's** [productive private key]([FAKER][CREDENTIALS][URL]) at the backend.

## Make a payment with your buyer user

Start the integration with your test seller user credentials:

1. Fill out [test card data](/developers/en/guides/additional-content/testing/test-cards).
1. Enter your test buyer user e-mail.
1. Confirm purchase. Done!
