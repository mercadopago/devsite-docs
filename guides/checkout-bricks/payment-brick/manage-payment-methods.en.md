# Manage payment methods

Payment Brick allows integration with multiple payment methods and, to do so, adjust the accepted payment methods in Brick's customizations. 

> To not include the payment method of a certain type, remove it from the `paymentMethods` object.

[[[
```Javascript
const settings = {
 ...,
 customization: {
   paymentMethods: {
     ...,
     creditCard: "all",
   },
 },
```
```react-jsx
const customization = {
 paymentMethods: {
   ...,
   creditCard: 'all'
 }
};
```
]]]

The table below shows the available payment methods:

> All types of payment methods accept the `all` option, so all options available for that type will be activated.
