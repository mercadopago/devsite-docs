> Include saved cards

In order for Payment Brick to be able to display the saved cards of a given buyer, it is necessary to send the customer ID and card IDs to Brick at the time of its initialization, as in the example below.

[[[
```Javascript
settings = {
   initialization: {
       ...,
       payer: {
           ...,
           customerId: '209277402-FqRqgEc3XItrxs',
           cardsIds: [ '1518023392627', '1518023332143' ]
       },
   },
   ...
}
```
]]]

Just passing these two properties, Brick will automatically give the user the option to make the payment with their saved cards.
