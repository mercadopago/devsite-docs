# Possible erros

Below you will find lists of errors that may occur during brick integration. Whether they are related to **sending variables** or **communication with external services** (Mercado Pago APIs).

## Variables passed by the integrator

During the Brick integration process, it is possible that **when the Brick is instantiated**, different errors related to sending variables may be shown to the integrator. These errors will be shown through a log in the browser console (the buyer does not receive any message).
