> Add external reference

By default, the Status Screen Brick does not show the `external_reference` field of the [Payments](/developers/en/reference/payments/_payments/post) API, but how this data can be useful to allow the integrator to identify the purchase on your website, you can enable the field through the configuration below.

```javascript
const settings = {
 initialization: {
   paymentId: 100, // payment id generated by Mercado Pago
 },
 callbacks: {
   onReady: () => {
     // callback called when Brick is ready
   },
   onError: (error) => {
     // callback called for all Brick error cases
   },
 },
 customization: {
   visual: {
       showExternalReference: true
   }
 }
};
```
