> Hide processing details

By default, when relevant, Brick will display details of payment processing, for example, reporting data that was entered incorrectly from a card or other [collection creation results](/developers/en/docs/checkout-api/response-handling/collection-results). If you wish, you can hide these details through the configuration below.

```javascript
const settings = {
 initialization: {
   paymentId: 100, // payment id generated by Mercado Pago
 },
 callbacks: {
   onReady: () => {
     // callback called when Brick is ready
   },
   onError: (error) => {
     // callback called for all Brick error cases
   },
 },
 customization: {
   visual: {
       hideStatusDetails: true
   }
 }
};
```
