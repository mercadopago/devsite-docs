# Transition states

In addition to handling conventional payment statuses (`pending`, `approved` or `rejected`), the Status Screen Brick also provides an additional experience for **pending payments** by **_Challenge_**, in the case of [3DS 2.0](/developers/en/docs/checkout-bricks/how-tos/improve-payment-approval/3ds), or other cases that require redirection to external domains.

The integration process follows the same structure as the other states. Check out [here](/developers/en/docs/checkout-bricks/status-screen-brick/default-rendering) for more details on the process.
