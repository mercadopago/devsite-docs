# Create container

You will need to create a container to define where the brick will be placed on the screen. The creation of the container is done by inserting an element (for example, a div) in the HTML code of the page where the brick will be rendered (see the code below).

>NOTE

> The value shown in the `id` property below is just an example and can be altered, however, it should always match the `id` indicated in the render.

```html
  <div id="cardPaymentBrick_container"></div>
```
