Use our official libraries to access Mercado Pago's features safely from your frontend.

<script src="https://sdk.mercadopago.com/js/v2"></script>
```
```bash
npm install @mercadopago/sdk-react
```
]]]

## Initialize Mercado Pago library

Then, initialize the Mercado Pago library to use Checkout Bricks.

const mp = new MercadoPago('YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY');
const bricksBuilder = mp.bricks();
```
```react-jsx
import { initMercadoPago } from '@mercadopago/sdk-react';
initMercadoPago('YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY');
```
]]]
