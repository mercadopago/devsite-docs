Wallet Brick offers two reading levels: the **call to action (button)** and the **value proposition (Value Prop)**. In both cases, the text can be customized according to the options provided by Mercado Pago.

The "call to action" is divided into two parts: the action, determined by the `Action` property, and the complement of the action, determined by the `Action Complement` property.
