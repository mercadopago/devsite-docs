# Introduction

Checkout Bricks viabiliza uma integração client-side de forma modular por meio de estruturas configuráveis, seguras e com integração simplificada e unificada. Todos os bricks possuem fluxos de controle do componente de UI e validação dos dados, o que faz com que o processo de integração ocorra a partir de configurações iniciais, métodos e callbacks utilizados por cada brick além de possuírem as seguintes características básicas:

* [Responsiveness](#bookmark_responsiveness)

## Responsiveness
