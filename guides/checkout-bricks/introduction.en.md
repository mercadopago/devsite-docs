Checkout Bricks enables a client-side integration in a modular way through configurable and secure structures with simplified and unified integration. All Bricks have UI component control flows and data validation, which makes the integration process occur from initial configurations, methods and callbacks used by each Brick, in addition to having the following basic characteristics:

* [Responsiveness](#bookmark_responsiveness)

## Responsiveness

The Brick has responsive capabilities in terms of the size within the screen. The Brick will always occupy the space that has been defined for it and will respond when this space changes during its use.
