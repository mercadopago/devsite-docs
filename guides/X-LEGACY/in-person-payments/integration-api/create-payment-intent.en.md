#  Start processing your payments

To start processing your payments, follow these steps:

## Get the list of your available devices

Before creating a payment intent, you must obtain the list of Point devices associated with your account. You can do it in the following way:

``` curl
curl --location --request GET 'https://api.mercadopago.com/point/integration-api/devices' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer ${ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
```

You will receive a response like this:

```json
{
  "id":"7d8c70b6-2ac8-4c57-a441-c319088ca3ca",
  "device_id":"INGENICO_MOVE2500__ING-ARG-14886780",
  "amount":1500,
  "description":"this is an example",
  "payment":{
     "type":"credit_card",
     "installments":1
  },
  "additional_info":{
     "external_reference":"4561ads-das4das4-das4754-das456",
     "print_on_terminal":true
  }
}
```
## Create the payment intent

You can create a payment intent and assign it to your Point device in the following way:

----[mla]----
```curl
curl --location --request POST 'https://api.mercadopago.com/point/integration-api/devices/:deviceId/payment-intents' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer ${ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
--data-raw '{
   "amount": 1500,
   "additional_info": {
       "external_reference": "4561ads-das4das4-das4754-das456",
       "print_on_terminal": true,
       "ticket_number": "S0392JED"
   }
}'
```

Field | Description
:--- | :--- |
'amount'             | Total amount of the payment intent. **Important**: this field does not allow decimal points. Therefore, if you want to generate a payment intent, you must consider the two decimals of the value in its total. For example: to generate payment order value "15.00" you must enter "1500". |
'external_reference' | Field exclusively used by the integrator to include references to their system.|
'print_on_terminal'  | Field that determines if the device prints the payment receipt. |
'ticket_number'      | Ticket number of the payment intent. |

In response, you will receive something similar to this:

```json
{
 "id": "7d8c70b6-2ac8-4c57-a441-c319088ca3ca",
 "device_id": "INGENICO_MOVE2500__ING-ARG-14886780",
 "amount": 1500,
 "additional_info": {
     "external_reference": "4561ads-das4das4-das4754-das456",
     "print_on_terminal": true,
     "ticket_number": "S0392JED"
 }
}
```
