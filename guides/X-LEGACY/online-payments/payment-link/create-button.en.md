# How to create a payment link?

Receiving payments through social networks, email or website is very easy.

## Basic settings

When creating a new payment link from your Mercado Pago account, you must define:

1. **The title of your product or service:** It will be the name that your buyer will see when making the payment. Remember that it should be as detailed as possible so that they can identify you better.
2. **Price:** It is the final amount to be paid by your customers.

3. **Photo (optional):** You can add a photo that represents the product or service you are selling. Remember that it is important to give security to your buyers.
