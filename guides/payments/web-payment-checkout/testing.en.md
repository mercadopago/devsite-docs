# Test the Integration

Before going into production, it is very important to test the payments flow, checking whether the configurations you made at the preference level are effectively reflected in the checkout.
You should check if:

+ The information about the product or service to be paid is correct.
+ If you recognize the customerâ€™s account to send the email.
+ It offers the payment methods you wish.
+ Your customer is correctly redirected after the payment is completed.
+ The payment experience is adequate and the payment result is reported.

##How to run tests?

### Create a test user

To simulate the whole payment process, you must create 2 test users: **seller** and **buyer**.

You must make the following API request to create each of the users.

Use the site_id to indicate the country where you want to run the test.

| Pais  | Site_id |
| ---- 	| ----- |
| Argentina   | **MLA** |
| Brazil  |  **MLB** |
| Mexico  |  **MLM** |
| Venezuela |  **MLV** |
| Chile |  **MLC** |
| Uruguay |  **MLU** |
| Peru  |  **MPE** |
| Colombia  |  **MCO** |

##### _Request_
[[[
```php
<?php

  MercadoPago\SDK::setAccessToken("ENV_ACCESS_TOKEN");

  $body = array(
    "json_data" => array(
      "site_id" => "[FAKER][GLOBALIZE][UPPER_SITE_ID]"
    )
  );

  $result = MercadoPago\SDK::post('/users/test_user', $body);

  var_dump($result);
?>
```
```curl
curl -X POST \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
"https://api.mercadopago.com/users/test_user?access_token=ENV_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
-d '{"site_id":"[FAKER][GLOBALIZE][UPPER_SITE_ID]"}'
```
]]]
##### _Response_
```json
{
    "id": 123456,
    "nickname": "TT123456",
    "password": "qatest123456",
    "site_status": "active",
    "email": "test_user_123456@testuser.com"
}
```

### Perform the corresponding tests

The complete process for testing the checkout is as follows:

1. Log in to Mercado Pago with the **seller** and get the [credentials](https://www.mercadopago.com/mla/account/credentials) to configure them in the creation of the payment preference.
2. Log out from MercadoPago.
3. Send the **buyer's** mail in the payment preference.
4. Complete the form, entering the digits of a test card. On the expiration date you must enter any date after the current date, as well as a 4-digit security code for Amex cards or a 3-digit security code for any other card.
5. To test the different payment results (approved, declined or pending), enter one of the following prefixes in the cardholder name field:
  * **APRO**: Payment approved.  
  * **CONT**: Pending payment.  
  * **CALL**: Payment declined, call to authorize.  
  * **FUND**: Payment declined due to insufficient funds.  
  * **SECU**: Payment declined by security code.  
  * **EXPI**: Payment declined by expiration date.  
  * **FORM**: Payment declined due to error in form.  
  * **OTHE**: General decline.  
6. In case of payment declined, you can retry it and simulate any other result as indicated in the previous item.
7. Check whether the notification has arrived correctly
8. Make a refund of an approved payment and check if you received the notification with the payment status updated.
