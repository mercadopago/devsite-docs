On your Mercado Pago account, [you have the option to create a link](https://www.mercadopago.com.ar/tools/create) to be sent to your buyer for making the payment.

You do not need to know programming.

We will guide you so that you can set the:

* Price, description and photo of what you sell.
* If you want to use **(Mercado Envíos)**.
* Payment methods accepted: credit or debit cards and payments in cash.
* Date in which payments are allowed.
* Reference code to identify the sale on your backend.
* URL redirecting to your website.

With this configuration, **you will get a link** that you can send by e-mail, post on social networks, or wherever you want.

By clicking on this link, your buyers will be redirected to the checkout where they will see the information that you have configured and will be able to choose how to pay. They can make the payment without the need for a Mercado Pago account.

In addition, we will provide you with an **HTML Code** you can include in your website and a **QR Code** you can share with your customers.
