# Test the Integration

Before going into production, it is very important to test the complete payment flow, checking whether the creation of payments is carried out correctly and the messages efficiently communicate to the users.

A good customer experience at the checkout helps to ensure the conversion.

You have a pair of [sandbox keys](https://www.mercadopago.com.ar/account/credentials?type=custom) which will allow you to test the whole integration based on an exact replica of the Production Mode, being able to simulate transactions using the test cards:


| Country 	 | Visa 				       | Mastercard        | American Express |
| ---- 		   | ---- 				       | ----------        | ---------------- |

You can also [use test credit cards from local payment methods in each country](/guides/localization/local-cards.en.md).

## Collect card information

With your `public_key` you can securely get the credit card data entered in the form. Make sure that the payment method available for the card number and the number of installments with the corresponding financing is correctly entered.

Check if the `card_token` generated when submitting the form contains information, for example, by checking whether the first_six_digits attribute contains a value.

In case any data entered is incorrect, we will display an error code specifying what should be corrected.

## Receive a payment

You can simulate the creation of a payment using your `access_token` and `card_token`.

If at the time of creation, you get an error associated with the payment method selected or the accounts in operation, you will receive an HTTP Status 400 Bad Request and the code detailing the error so that you can correct and retry the payment.

Try all possible payment scenarios for payment approved, pending or declined. To do this, in the card_holder_name field of the form, enter any of the following prefixes:

* **APRO**: Payment approved.  
* **CONT**: Pending payment.  
* **CALL**: Payment declined, call to authorize.  
* **FUND**: Payment declined due to insufficient funds.  
* **SECU**: Payment declined by security code.  
* **EXPI**: Payment declined by expiration date.  
* **FORM**: Payment declined due to error in form.  
* **OTHE**: General decline.  

In each case, you must communicate the payment result and the next steps to your customer. For that, you will receive an HTTP Status 201 OK informing that the payment has been created correctly and we will send a result code so that you can redirect the customer to the page with the correct message.

## Check if you have received the Webhook notification

Mercado Pago will send you a notification of the occurrence of an event. Make sure that you successfully received it and duly impacted your management system.

### Cancel a payment

Make a refund for an approved payment or the cancellation of a pending payment and check if you receive the notification with the corresponding information.


## Test the creation of a customer

Check if you have created the `customer` with the associated card and the card data is duly retrieved when you reload the checkout.
