# Integration configuration

The integration of Money Out is done by making a single API call to [v1/transaction-intents](https://api.mercadopago.com/v1/transaction-intents). This way, the transaction is created and processed in a single request and, if successful, the money will be available to be withdrawn to the destination account, without the need for additional steps. 

----[mlb]----

With Money Out, you can send money in two different ways: via Pix, or by transferring to a bank account, whether it's a Mercado Pago account or not. Follow the instructions below to learn how to integrate in each case.

> WARNING
>
> Important
>
> To set up the integration and test its proper functioning before going live, you'll need to use your **test Access Token**.. 

## Set up withdrawals via Pix

To integrate Money Out and enable money withdrawals via Pix, you'll need to send a **POST** request, with your **test Access Token** in the `Authorization` header and your idempotency key in the `X-Idempotency-Key` header, to the endpoint [/v1/transaction-intents/process](https://api.mercadopago.com/v1/transaction-intents/process). You should send the corresponding parameters following the instructions in the table below.

> NOTE
>
> Note
>
> Please note that only one destination account (`transaction.to`) per call is allowed. Additionally, the integrator's Pix key must have been previously registered, and the destination account's key must be active.

## Set up notifications

In order to keep track of the status of your transactions, you must configure the [Webhook notifications](/developers/en/docs/money-out/additional-content/your-integrations/notifications/webhooks). These are messages sent by the Mercado Pago server in response to events that occur in your application. Specifically for Money Out, these events can be either the creation of a transaction or the status updates that the transaction goes through during its processing.

You can **configure your Webhook notifications when creating a transaction** by using the `notification_url` field. Simply fill it with the URL where you want to receive your updates.

You can see examples of the messages you will receive when registering an event below.

#### - Message for transaction creation.

```json
{
  "action": "transaction_intent.created",
  "api_version": "v1",
  "data": {
    "id": "1108917506-01GGTH198RP0K71H133EK9BJAT" // ID of the transaction intent
  },
  "date_created": "2022-11-01T17:19:53.915-04:00",
  "id": "103686924004", // ID of the notification
  "last_updated": "0001-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "status": "new",
  "type": "transaction_intent"
}
```

#### - Message for a transaction update.

```json
{
  "action": "transaction_intent.updated",
  "api_version": "v1",
  "data": {
    "id": "1108917506-01GGTH198RP0K71H133EK9BJAT" // ID of the transaction intent
  },
  "date_created": "2022-11-01T17:19:53.915-04:00",
  "id": "103686918006", // ID of the notification
  "last_updated": "2022-11-01T17:19:55.001-04:00",
  "status": "partially_processed",
  "type": "transaction_intent"
}
```

The `data.id` attribute corresponds to the ID of the transaction being notified to you, the `id` parameter will be the identifier of the notification, and `status` will inform you whether it is the creation of the transaction or the update of its status.


### Required actions after receiving the notification

When you receive a notification on your platform, you should first validate the information of the notified resource. To do this, execute the request for [Get information about a transaction](/developers/en/docs/money-out/integration-configuration#bookmark_get_information_about_a_transaction) using the transaction ID that was notified to you.

Once the transaction data is cross-validated and verified, Mercado Pago expects a response to ensure that the notification was received correctly. To do this, you should return an `HTTP STATUS 200 (OK)` or `201 (CREATED)` to the URL sent in the `notification_url` field. If this response is not sent, it will be understood that you have not received the notification and a new sending attempt will be made until the response is received.

In the following table, you can find the main events, deadlines, and waiting time to receive new notification attempts.

| Event | Deadline after the first sending | Confirmation waiting time |
|---|---|---|
| Sending | - | 22 seconds |
| First attempt | 15 minutes | 5 seconds |
| Second attempt | 30 minutes | 5 seconds |
| Third attempt | 6 hours | 5 seconds |
| Fourth attempt | 48 hours | 5 seconds |
| Fifth attempt | 96 hours | 5 seconds |


## Get information about a transaction
If you wish, you can retrieve information about a transaction. This can be useful to confirm that it was created correctly, to check its `status`, or to verify the information received in your notifications.

To do so, send a **GET** request with your Access Token to the endpoint [/v1/transaction-intents/{{transaction_intent_id}}](https://api.mercadopago.com/v1/transaction-intents/{id}), replacing `transaction_intent_id` with the ID obtained in the response at the time of creating the transaction.

```curl
curl --location --request GET 'https://api.mercadopago.com/v1/transaction-intents/{{transaction_intent_id}}' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer {{access_token}}'
``` 

If the data sent in the call is correct, you will receive a response like the following:

```json
{
  "id": "0d5020ed",
  "status": "approved",
  "created_date": "2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "external_reference": "123456",
  "last_updated_date": "2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "point_of_interaction": "PSP_TRANSFER",
  "seller_configuration": {
    "notification_info": {
      "notification_url": "www.ejemplo.cl"
    }
  },
  "transaction": {
    "from": {
      "accounts": [
        {
          "amount": "100,00"
        }
      ]
    },
    "to": {
      "accounts": [
        {
          "amount": "100,00",
          "status_detail": "approved",
          "owner": {
            "identification": {
              "number": "1234567890",
              "type": "RUT"
            }
          },
          "bank_id": "0000014",
          "type": "checking_account",
          "number": "123456"
        }
      ]
    },
    "paid_amount": 100,
    "refunded_amount": 1,
    "payer": {
      "id": 123456543
    },
    "total_amount": 100
  }
}
```

To know the details of each returned attribute, refer to the response in the [Withdrawals Configuration](/developers/en/docs/money-out/integration-configuration#bookmark_integration_configuration).

### Possible transaction status

When you create a transaction or when you query information related to it, the responses will return two fields that allow you to know the state in which it currently stands.

On one hand, the `status` field will provide information regarding the current processing status. On the other hand, the `status_detail` field, found as an attribute of `transaction.to.accounts`, will allow you to understand the reasons or details that resulted in that status.

Below, you can see all the possible status a transaction can go through during its processing.

| `status` | `status_detail` | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `approved` | `approved` | The transaction processing was successful. |
| `approved` | `partially_refunded` | The transaction was partially refunded by the destination bank. |
| `in_process` | `pending_authorized` | The transaction is in process, awaiting final status, and awaits authorization. |
| `in_process` | `pending_bank` | The destination bank did not respond, so the transaction is pending final status. |
| `refunded` | `refunded` | The transaction was refunded by the destination bank. |
| `rejected` | `by_bank` | The destination bank rejected the transfer. Please make the request again. |
| `rejected` | `by_provider` | The provider rejected the transfer. Please make the request again. |
| `rejected` | `high_risk` | The transaction is rejected due to fraud risk. Please make the request again. |
| `rejected` | `insufficient_funds` | Transaction rejected due to insufficient funds in the origin account. Please make the request again. |
| `rejected` | `other_reason` | Transaction rejected by default due to internal issues during processing. Please make the request again. |
| `rejected` | `review_manual` | The transaction is rejected and referred to fraud prevention for analysis. Please make the request again. |
