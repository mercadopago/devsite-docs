> If the partner platform does not have a Mercado Pago account in the name of the platform itself, it will be necessary to [create an account](https://www.mercadopago[FAKER][URL][DOMAIN]/registration-mp?mode=mp) to apply your account ID to the transactions.

To obtain the Mercado Pago account ID, follow these steps:

1. Access your account's credentials panel. If you don't have any applications created, you will see a button to create a new application.

3. In the **Production credentials** section, you can view your integration keys.

4. Locate the Access Token and note the last characters of the private key. These characters correspond to your Mercado Pago account ID.

Below, you can see an example of how to view the Mercado Pago account ID:

You can use this account ID in your integrations and payment requests in the `sponsor_id` field to associate the transactions with your Mercado Pago account.
