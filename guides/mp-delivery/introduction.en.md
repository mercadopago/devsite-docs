# Mercado Pago Delivery

Mercado Pago Delivery is an on-demand meal delivery solution in which the customer enters a list of registered restaurants, selects their order and pays directly from the Mercado Pago application.

You can integrate your restaurant's POS with Mercado Pago Delivery to:

* Receive and accept orders automatically.
* Easily manage inventory and finances.
* Close the cash register efficiently using the already integrated reconciliation solution, displaying in detail all the financial transactions carried out.

The seller can use Mercado Pago Delivery in two ways: through an **integration with a POS using our APIs** or through the **Order Manager**, which is a tool that is available on the Mercado Pago portal.

The **Order Manager** is a tool responsible for controlling the entire flow of an order. To access it, go to the [Mercado Pago user panel](https://www.mercadopago[FAKER][URL][DOMAIN]/home) and click on **Delivery > Order Manager**. It is only for restaurants that do not have a management software integrated with Mercado Pago, since it is not possible to integrate the Manager with another order management software.

The order management software, after performing the integration, will receive notifications of new orders through a webhook registered during the process of creating an application within Mercado Pago.
