# Cancel order

To cancel an order that was accepted in the POS, perform a PUT sending the `shipment_id` and the` access-token` (generated by the OAuth authentication process) to the endpoint [/proximity-integration/shipment/{shipment_id}/cancel](/developers/pt/reference/mp_delivery/_proximity-integration_shipments_shipment_id_cancel/put). 

Check [Security](/developers/en/guides/additional-content/security/oauth/introduction) for more information about OAuth.
