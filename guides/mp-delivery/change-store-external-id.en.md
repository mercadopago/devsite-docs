# Change external store ID

There is also the possibility to create an external ID (`external_id`) for a certain store. This field is optional, but can be used as an identifier for the order management software system.

To enter the value of an external ID in a store, perform a PUT sending the `store_id` and `access_token` (generated by the OAuth authentication process) to the endpoint [/proximity-integration/stores/{StoreID}/ external_id](/developers/en/reference/mp_delivery/_proximity-integration_stores_StoreID_external_id/put). See [Security](/developers/en/guides/additional-content/security/oauth/introduction) for more information about OAuth.

> You will also be able to consult the information of a store through its external ID. For that, just send as request parameters the `user_id` related to the store, the `external_id` and the `access_token`. Check more information in the API [Get store by external ID](/developers/en/reference/mp_delivery/_proximity-integration_users_SellerID_stores_external_id_ExternalID/get).
