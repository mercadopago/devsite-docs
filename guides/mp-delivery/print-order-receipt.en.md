# Print order receipt

After accepting the order, you will be able to print your receipt in **PDF format**.

To print it, perform a GET sending the `shipment_id` and `access-token` (generated by the OAuth authentication process) to the endpoint [/proximity-integration/shipments/{shipment_id}/print_label_pdf](/developers/pt/reference/mp_delivery/_proximity-integration_shipments_shipment_id_print_label_pdf/get). Check [Security](/developers/en/guides/additional-content/security/oauth/introduction) for more information about OAuth.

The receipt can always be printed, except when the order has [status canceled or sent](/developers/en/docs/mp-delivery/order-management/get-order-data).
