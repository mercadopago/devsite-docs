# Accept order

When the delivery status returns **Ready_to_ship** you can accept the order.

To accept the order that was confirmed at the POS, perform a PUT sending the `shipment_id` and `access-token` (generated by the OAuth authentication process) to the endpoint [/proximity-integration/shipments/{shipment_id}/accept](/developers/en/reference/mp_delivery/_proximity-integration_shipments_shipment_id_accept/put). Check [Security](/developers/en/guides/additional-content/security/oauth/introduction) for more information about OAuth.

When accepting the order, the status will be changed and the new order status will be indicated in the response.

> NOTE

> It is important to know that only in the statuses **ready_to_ship** and **ready_to_print** it is possible to accept an order. After accepting the order, the substatus will be **printed**. If the order is not accepted 5 minutes after its creation, it will be automatically cancelled.
