 - title: Integration
 - type: reversed
 - message: The integration of the POS with Mercado Pago Delivery is done through APIs or the Order Manager tool in the Mercado Pago business panel, which is in charge of controlling the entire flow of an order for restaurants that do not have management software integrated with Mercado Pago. Once integrated, the notifications of new orders are sent to the POS that consults the data of the order and accepts it.
