# Catalog management

Catalog management is carried out through API REST, which allows you to perform the following functionalities:

* Perform bulk catalog upload for multiple stores.
* Verify the successful completion of the catalog upload process.
* Update the status of an item using its SKU.

The catalog upload process is asynchronous.

> We recommend **always monitoring the catalog upload process through the endpoint**, as even if you receive a positive response when using the catalog upload, this is the safest way to verify that the process has completed successfully.
