# Apps section

We've created the Apps section so that users of [Point Smart](/developers/en/docs/mp-point/integration-configuration/integrate-with-pdv/introduction) can incorporate new solutions and tools into their sales experiences, stock control, customer relations, and business management.

Point Smart is constantly growing, with new integrated applications. Below, you can learn a little more about how it works.

## Access

To access, you just need to go to the **More options** section and then select the "Apps" tab in the upper right corner.

## Structure

It is divided into two parts:

* **Your business applications**, where the applications already installed by the user are located.
* **Available applications**, the section that gathers apps that can be downloaded.

## Detail page

To learn more about an app, by clicking on **Learn more**, the user is directed to a page with details, unique features, and functionalities, as well as screenshots that illustrate the experience.

Many times, this is the first contact; therefore, there is ample space for clear, objective communication that explores the benefits. Later on, we will provide recommendations on how to explore all these opportunities.
