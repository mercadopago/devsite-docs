# Architecture and navigation

The way we organize information and plan experiences should be consistent with users' mental models. These tips will help you do it faster.

## Replicate patterns

Whenever possible, try to replicate the same navigation and interaction patterns from your native app within the Smart mini app.

## Maintain the same architecture

Users who use your application outside of Smart can transition to using it within the reader, and vice versa. Having the same information architecture across all platforms is important for them to feel oriented and continue to fulfill your objectives.

## Use the same reader interactions

Users of the [Point Smart](/developers/en/docs/mp-point/integration-configuration/integrate-with-pdv/introduction) are already accustomed to the functions of physical and virtual buttons. Try to use these same behaviors within your app for greater adoption and recurrent use.
