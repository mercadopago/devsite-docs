# How to install applications on Redelcom devices with MacOS and Windows 

In order to perform integrations with Redelcom terminals, you may need to install an Android application, such as RDCPass, or your own application that allows you to connect with RDCPass. 

If you are working with MacOS or Windows as your operating system, `adb` (Android Debug Bridge) is the tool that will allow you to install applications on the terminals to communicate with RDCPass properly.

Below, we present a step-by-step guide to help you install `adb` on your MacOS and/or Windows computers and install your Android application.

## How to install your Android App on MacOS 

1. Start by installing `adb` on your MacOS computer by running the following command in the computer's terminal:

```terminal

brew install android-platform-tools;

```

2. Once the installation is complete, test if `adb` detects the Redelcom device properly. To do this, connect it to the computer via USB and run the following command:

```terminal

adb devices

```

If `adb` detects the device correctly, you will receive a response like the following.

```terminal

List of devices attached 
1850796495     device

```

3. Finally, still from the computer's terminal, navigate to the folder where the Android application to be installed is located and execute the following command, replacing "prueba.apk" with the file name and the `apk` extension.

```terminal

adb install prueba.apk

```

Once the installation process is complete, the response will be similar to the following:

```terminal

Performing Streamed Installed
Success

```

Done! You have installed your Android application using `adb` to integrate your payments. Now, you can choose the [integration type](/developers/en/docs/redelcom/types-of-integration) you prefer to start operating with Redelcom. 

## How to install your Android App on Windows

1. Download the Android SDK by accessing its [official website](https://developer.android.com/tools/releases/platform-tools?hl=es-419#downloads) and clicking on "How to download the SDK Platform Tools for Windows". You will need to read and accept their terms and conditions to proceed.

```terminal

adb.exe devices

```

If `adb` detects the device correctly, you will receive a response like the following.

```terminal

List of devices attached 
1850796495     device
```

4. Copy and paste your Android application into the **platform-tools** folder. 
5. Lastly, still from the computer's terminal and in the platform-tools folder, execute the following command, replacing "filename+extension" with the name of your application followed by its extension.

```terminal

adb.exe install filename + extension

```

Done! You have installed your Android application using `adb` to integrate your payments. Now, you can choose the [integration type](/developers/en/docs/redelcom/types-of-integration) you prefer to start operating with Redelcom.
