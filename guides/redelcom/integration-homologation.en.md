# How to homologate your integration

Before going into production, it is necessary to homologate the integration to ensure that it is meeting the necessary quality standards.

Whether it is a local integration or an integration via API, this process will be done through a video call with our team, who will guide you step by step.

The purpose of this documentation is to understand, before the video call, what the prerequisites are, what the process will consist of, and how you should proceed after receiving approval from our team.

## Prerequisites

To homologate your integration with Redelcom, whether it is a local integration or via API, make sure the following prerequisites are met before scheduling the video call.

| Requirements | Description |
|---|---|
| Redelcom device serial number and model | The team will request the serial number and model of the Redelcom device. This information is available on the back of the device. |
| **Optional**. External printer | If you use an external printer to print the receipts from the Redelcom device, it is important to have it nearby during the video call to demonstrate how the receipts look after being generated. |

If all prerequisites have been met, choose the type of integration you have completed and want to homologate to learn about the process:
