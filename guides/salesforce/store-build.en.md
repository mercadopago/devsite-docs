# Build the store

In order for the Mercado Pago cartridge to work correctly with your website, you must integrate it with the store so that it maintains its functionality along with other cartridges you have installed.

For this, it is necessary to build the store following the steps described below.

1. Open a Command Prompt terminal and access the "int_mercadopago" folder.
2. Run the following commands:
- `npm install`
- `npm run build`

Done, you already have the cartridge code integrated into the store site.
