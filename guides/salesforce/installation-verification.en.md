# Verify the Mercado Pago installation

To ensure that the Mercado Pago cartridge is installed, follow these steps.

1. Within your Salesforce Commerce Cloud store, go to the **Merchant Tools** menu and click the **Payment Processors** option found within the Ordering group of options. You can also find the option using the menu search engine.
2. In the **Processor ID** column, confirm that these options exist depending on the payment methods you have already integrated:
    * MERCADOPAGO_CHECKOUT_PRO if you integrated Mercado Pago.
    * MERCADOPAGO_CREDIT_CARD if you integrated payments with credit and/or debit cards.
    ----[mlb]----
    * MERCADOPAGO_PIX if you integrated payments with Pix
    ------------

You don't need to do any additional configuration in this instance.
