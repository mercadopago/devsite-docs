If you want to change this order, follow these steps.

1. Within your Salesforce Commerce Cloud store, go to the **Merchant Tools** menu and click the **Payment Methods** option found within the Ordering group of options. You can also find the option using the menu search engine.
2. Within the box, look for the **Sort Order** column. In this column, assign a numerical order to the payment methods of your store to define the order in which you want to display them.
