# Integrate the cartridge with the store site

First, you'll need to download the current state of your store's site. For that, go to **Administration > Site Development > Code Deployment**. enter the active version and download it. Then unzip the .zip file you downloaded.

Then, download the latest version of "int_mercadopago", the Mercado Pago integrator, from [Salesforce Partner Marketplace](https://www.salesforce.com/products/commerce-cloud/partner-marketplace/partners/mercado-pago/).

Lastly, unzip the .zip file and place its contents in the same folder on the store site. In this way, the "int_mercadopago" folder must be at the same level as the "app_storefront_base" folder.
