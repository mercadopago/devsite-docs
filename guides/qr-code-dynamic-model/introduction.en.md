# What is the dynamic QR model?

It allows to have the amount collectible already included in the QR code. Each QR represents a single order and amount. **Its main characteristic is the one-time payment**, that is, once the payment is made, the QR cannot be reused.

This model is ideal for QR code ticket collection and desk service models, or for preset payments, among others. 


## Main characteristics

The main characteristics are:

- The value is already configured in the QR code.
- The QR code printed on a ticket or screen can be shown. A fixed QR code at the cashier's is not required.
- You may collect several orders at the same time with different codes.
