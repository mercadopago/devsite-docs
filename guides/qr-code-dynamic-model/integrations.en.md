# How to integrate the QR dynamic model

For collection using the QR code dynamic model, you should create both an order and a code with an external service, based on the relevant response.

## Model flow

Find below how this model works:

1. An order with all required payment data is created.
2. The response will include a data string under the attribute `qr_data`.
3. A QR code with the received attribute is generated.
4. Finally, the QR code is made available to the customer, at your choice, to make the payment.

## Create an order

First, generate the order publication. Once data is sent to Mercado Pago, a data string with [EMVCo](https://www.emvco.com/emv-technologies/qrcodes) standard will be made available.

Execute the following API call to create an order. The response will include the data required to create the QR code.

```curl
curl -X POST \
 https://api.mercadopago.com/instore/orders/qr/seller/collectors/USER_ID/pos/EXTERNAL_POS_ID/qrs \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN' \
 -d '{
    "external_reference": "order-id-1234",
    "title": "Title",
    "description": "Mercado Pago",
    "notification_url": "https://www.yourserver.com",
    "expiration_date": "2023-08-22T16:34:56.559-04:00",
    "total_amount": 1190,
    "items": [
        {
            "sku_number": "KS955RUR",
            "category": "FOOD",
            "title": "Item1",
            "description": "Item1 Mercado Pago",
            "unit_price": 238,
            "quantity": 5,
            "unit_measure": "unit",
            "total_amount": 1190
        }
    ],
    "sponsor": {
                "id": 820480089
            }----[mco]----,
    "taxes": [
        {
            "value": 190,
            "type": "IVA"
        }
    ]------------
}'
```

> If you must pay IVA for the products in your order, visit the [Considerations IVA Colombia section](https://www.mercadopago[FAKER][URL][DOMAIN]/developers/en/guides/resources/localization/iva-colombia).

> The model does not include a **delete order** option. Therefore, we recommend setting an expiration date using the `expiration_date` attribute.

Response

```json
{
   "qr_data": "00020101021243650016COM.MERCADOLIBRE02013063638f1192a-5fd1-4180-a180-8bcae3556bc35204000053039865802BR5925IZABEL AAAA DE MELO6007BARUERI62070503***63040B6D"
}
```
The response will be a string with the [EMVCo](https://www.emvco.com/emv-technologies/qrcodes) standard. Use the `qr_data` to make the QR code available using either a generator or your application.

----[mlb]----

If you have a **Pix key configured in your Mercado Pago account**, the data string structure will have Pix-related data. 
For example:

```json
{
   "qr_data": "00020101021226940014BR.GOV.BCB.PIX2572pix-qr.mercadopago.com/instore/o/v2/fdf9ece0-6137-4e1e-a49d-94f55ec9eee25204000053039865802BR5925FELIPE AAAAAA AAAAA 6009SAO PAULO62070503***6304B61D"
}
```

------------


## Associate the order with a Point of Sale

In addition to generating the QR code, you also have the option to create and assign the same command to the Point of Saleâ€™s fixed QR code.

Execute the following API call to create an order and assign the Point of Sale. The response will include the data required to create the QR code.


```curl
curl -X PUT \
 https://api.mercadopago.com/instore/orders/qr/seller/collectors/USER_ID/pos/EXTERNAL_POS_ID/qrs \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN' \
 -d '{
    "external_reference": "order-id-1234",
    "title": "Title",
    "description": "Mercado Pago",
    "notification_url": "https://www.yourserver.com",
    "expiration_date": "2023-08-22T16:34:56.559-04:00",
    "total_amount": 1190,
    "items": [
        {
            "sku_number": "KS955RUR",
            "category": "FOOD",
            "title": "Item1",
            "description": "Item1 Mercado Pago",
            "unit_price": 238,
            "quantity": 5,
            "unit_measure": "unit",
            "total_amount": 1190
        }
    ],
    "sponsor": {
                "id": 820480089
            }----[mco]----,
    "taxes": [
        {
            "value": 190,
            "type": "IVA"
        }
    ]------------
}'
```

## Receive notifications of your orders

IPN notifications are an **automatic way of receiving notifications for order creation and status updates**. I.e.: when orders are approved, rejected or pending.

Implement IPN `merchant_order` with an order search by `external_reference` as a contingency method.
