# Prerequisites

To start the testing phase of your integration, you need to have the following prerequisites:

| Prerequisite | Description |
|---|---|
| Mercado Pago test accounts (for both seller and buyer) | Test accounts have the same characteristics as a real Mercado Pago account, allowing you to test the functionality of the integrations you are developing.<br>To create them, go to [Your integrations](/developers/en/docs/checkout-pro/additional-content/your-integrations/introduction), select the application you want to test, and access Test accounts. For more information, refer to the [Test accounts](/docs/checkout-pro/integration-test/prerequisites/test-accounts) documentation. |
| Production credentials of a test account | To test your integration, you need to use the **production credentials of the test user** you created. Learn more by accessing the [Credentials](/developers/en/docs/checkout-pro/additional-content/your-integrations/credentials) documentation. |
| Test cards | Test cards allow you to simulate different transactions without using a real card. Learn more by accessing our [Test cards](/developers/en/docs/checkout-pro/integration-test/prerequisites/test-cards) documentation. |
