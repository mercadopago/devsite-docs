# Go to production

Once your integration is ready and you want to start receiving payments, **activate your production credentials** and replace the test credentials.

Additionally, we recommend considering the following additional points:

## SSL Certificate

To ensure the security of the data involved in transactions and comply with legal regulations in each country, it is necessary to have an **SSL certificate** for your integration.

This process is designed to guarantee the security of your customers' data, comply with legal standards or regulations in each country, and provide the best purchasing experience for your sales.

While during the testing phase, you may not have an SSL certificate, it is mandatory to have one when going live.

## Reports

[Mercado Pago reports](/developers/es/docs/checkout-pro/additional-content/reports/introduction) provide financial information to track account transactions, such as available balance, movements, and liquidity. This makes it easier to reconcile sales and other operations with your internal management systems.

We recommend using the reports to improve your financial management once you go live.
