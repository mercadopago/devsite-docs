> Change button texts

The payment button offers two reading levels: the **call to action (button)** and the **value proposition**. In both cases, the text can be customized according to the options provided by Mercado Pago. By default, the payment button renders as in the following image.

To change the default texts, modify the `customization` property during rendering.

| Observations | When sending an empty text, the screen will present the text defined by the default layout. On the other hand, when sending alternative text, it will replace the default text. To check which alternative texts are available, see the table below. |

Check below the texts available for alteration and a code example.

| Key | Available options | Default |
| --- |--- | --- |
