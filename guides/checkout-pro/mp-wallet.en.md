# Mercado Pago Wallet

The option to pay with Mercado Pago Wallet, by default, is presented in all Mercado Pago Checkouts in combination with guest user payments (no login).

This option allows users registered in Mercado Pago and/or Mercado Livre to log in and use the available methods to make their payments, in addition to being able to include new payment options, such as credit cards.

It is possible to pay with **card** and **available balance** in a safe and optimized environment, increasing the chances of converting sales, in addition to allowing the seller to only offer payments with wallet. With this, the option to pay without logging in will not exist, however, it will contribute to an increase in the conversion of payments.

> Create preference

If you are a user and want all your payments to be made via Wallet, you can determine this via an attribute in the preferences API. To create a preference, use one of the SDKs below.

> In addition to the SDKs, it is also possible to create a preference through the preferences API. For that, send a **POST** with the parameter `purpose` and the value `wallet_purchase` to the endpoint [/checkout/preferences](/developers/en/reference/preferences/_checkout_preferences/post) and execute the request or, if you prefer, use one of the SDKs below.
