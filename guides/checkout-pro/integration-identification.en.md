## Identification of integrations
 
Certified members of the [&lt;dev>program](https://www.mercadopago.com.br/developers/en/developer-program) can identify their Checkout Pro integrations to gain access to [program benefits](https://www.mercadopago.com.br/developers/en/developer-program#dev-program-benefits). To do this, you need to identify your integrations in the request header by inserting your [Integrator ID](/developers/en/guides/additional-content/dashboard/header#bookmark_integrator_id)
 
To identify your integrations, send the `integrator_id` parameter to the endpoint [/checkout/preferences](https://www.mercadopago[FAKER][URL][DOMAIN]/developers/en/reference/preferences/_checkout_preferences/post) and execute the request or, if you prefer, check out SDKs to carry out the integration using our libraries.
