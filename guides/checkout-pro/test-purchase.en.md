# Test purchase
 
There are two ways to make the payment: as a **guest user**, filling in just an email address, and as a **registered user**, accessing a Mercado Pago account with username and password.
 
In this last scenario, previously saved cards and available account balance will be enabled as payment methods.
 
## Guest user
 
1. Follow the purchase flow and, when opening the checkout, enter the **buyer user** data.
2. Select **card** as payment method and enter the data of one of the cards available on our page of [national test cards](/developers/en/guides/additional-content/testing/test-cards).
3. Enter the email and complete the purchase.
 
## Registered user
 
1. Follow the purchase flow and, when opening the checkout, enter the **buyer user** data.
2. Access the Mercado Pago account using the **buyer test user**.
3. Select **card** as payment method.
4. Select one of the cards previously saved in the account or enter the data of one of the [national test cards](/developers/en/guides/additional-content/testing/test-cards).
 
Once you've finished testing and completed payments, the checkout will be installed and ready to process actual sales.
