# Accounts you integrate
 
You can integrate solutions for accounts other than your own. When integrating solutions for other accounts, you can request access to this account's credentials in order to maintain data security. This section contains the credentials for these other accounts. To request access, simply:
 
1. Access the Dashboard.
2. Click on the "Request credentials" button.
3. Fill in the email of the account that credentials will be requested for.
4. Confirm the credentials request.
 
After access to credentials is granted, you can use them to integrate solutions. When the integrations are complete, remove access permissions for the credentials that were shared and take care of data security.
