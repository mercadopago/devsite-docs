# Configuration
 
To ensure a better shopping experience and tighter integration with Shopify apps, it's important to customize specific information at checkout and on your store. To do so, follow the steps below.
 
1. Access your store's **Admin Panel** and click on **Settings > Checkout**.
2. Under **Form Options**, mark the item **Company Name** as **required**.
3. Go back to **Settings** and click on **Languages**.
4. In the **Default Language** section, click **Change Theme Languages**.
5. Choose English and click on Save.
6. Still on the language page, use the search bar and look for the **Company** field.
7. Replace all entries for **Company label**, **Optional company label**, **Address company blank**, and **Address â€“ Company** with the text **CPF/CNPJ**.
8. Click **Save**.

Once you have completed these steps, the checkout will be installed and configured. Now, make a trial purchase to ensure that all the steps have been done correctly and the checkout is ready to process your sales.
