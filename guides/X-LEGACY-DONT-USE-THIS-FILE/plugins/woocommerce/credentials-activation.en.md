# Credentials activation

In the **Add credentials to "Test Mode" or "Production Mode"** section, you must fill in your **production** and **test** credentials.

The **Production credential** will enable the store to process actual sales at the end of the initial tests. It is through this credential that the activation is complete.

The **Test credential** will be necessary at first to carry out tests to ensure the correct functioning of the purchase and payment flow.

To activate the credentials, follow the steps below.

1. Scroll down to the **Credentials** section.
2. On **Add credentials to "Test Mode"or "Production Mode"**, choose **Activate Test Mode for Mercado Pago checkouts**. (By keeping this field enabled, your store will be in **test mode**, which allows you to test the plugin before setting the store to production).
3. Enter your **test** and **production** credentials in the required fields. If you don't have this information, access the [Credentials](https://www.mercadopago.[FAKER][URL][DOMAIN]/developers/en/guides/resources/credentials/credentials) documentation and follow the required steps. 
4. When finished filling in, click on **Save changes**.

Set up the business information as shown in the next section once you fill in the credentials.
