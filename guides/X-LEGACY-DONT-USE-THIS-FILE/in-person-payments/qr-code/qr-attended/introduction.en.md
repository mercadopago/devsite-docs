# QR attended model

## What is the QR attended model?

After taking a client’s order, this **model allows an operator to connect the order with a Point of Sale** to complete the transaction.
This system is recommended for retail and restaurants, among others.

## Main characteristics

The main characteristics are:

- The operator always works from their Point of Sale system, that was previously set up with a Mercado Pago charge function. From that option, the order is sent to the associated POS.
- For a client to make a payment, an order needs to be linked to a POS.
- The operator can see the completed payment on their system.
