# How to improve payments approval

When making an online payment, the transaction undergoes a careful analysis to minimize fraud risks and ensure that processing takes place without errors.

In this documentation, you will find information about what causes a payment to be declined and some recommendations to prevent this from happening.

## Why is a payment order rejected?

A payment may be declined due to an **issue with the payment method or because it does not meet the necessary security requirements**. For example, if the card does not have enough amount or if there is a strange movement of the account.

## Reasons for refusal

Payment refusal is a reality in the world of online sales and can happen for several reasons: incorrect filling of information by the customer, attempted fraud, problem in communication between acquirers, among many other issues.

## Recommendations to improve your approval

To prevent a legitimate payment from being refused because it does not meet security validations, **it is necessary to include all possible information** when carrying out the transaction. Furthermore, you must pay attention to some security requirements, such as our **Security Code** and **Device ID**.

### Implement the Device ID in your site

The Device ID is an important piece of information to ensure better security and, consequently, a better payment approval rate. **It's a unique number that's used to identify a customer's device** when they are buying.

If a customer makes a purchase on a different device than usual, this may mean that the purchase was fake and should not be done.
