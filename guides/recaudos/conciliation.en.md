# Reconciliation

For payment reconciliation, we have the Mercado Pago reconciliation reports available in your account.

The [Account balance](/developers/en/docs/reports/account-money/introduction) report provides access to details of each transaction in the account. On the same page, you can set up a custom SFTP repository to receive the report and specify the frequency for generating the information.
