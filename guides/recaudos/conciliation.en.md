# Reconciliation

For payment reconciliation, we have the Mercado Pago reconciliation reports available in your account.

In the [Account balance](/developers/pt/docs/reports/account-money/introduction) report, you will be able to access the details of each movement in the account. On the same page, you can set up a custom SFTP repository to receive the report and determine how often you want to generate the information.
