To integrate the payment method, follow the steps below.

1. Go to the **Stores > Configuration > Sales > Payment Methods** menu.
2. To activate card payments, access the **Mercado Pago > Custom Checkout - Bank Transfer** section.
3. Select **Yes** to activate the Mercado Pago experience for bank transfer payments at your store checkout.
4. If necessary, **change the title of the payment method** that will appear for the buyer.
5. If you wish, you can customize a **banner** with the available payment methods by changing the URL of the image in question. By default, the Mercado Pago module will configure a banner with the available payment methods according to your country.
6. In **Checkout Position**, indicate the position in which the payment method will be available to the buyer in the checkout flow.
7. In the **Redirect Payer** field, indicate whether the buyer will be automatically redirected to the bank's payment page, without having to go through an intermediate page in your store.
8. Then click** **Save Config** to save your preferences.
