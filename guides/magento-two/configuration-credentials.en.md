# Configure your credentials

First, you must enter your credentials to enable the payment methods available in the country where the store is from.

1. Go to the menu Stores > Configuration > Sales > Payment Methods

2. For this step, we recommend that you have your [Credentials]([FAKER][CREDENTIALS][URL]). Then, access the option **Mercado Pago> Credentials**. There you will find the **Public key** and **Access token** fields, which you must complete with your credentials.

There are two types of credentials:

- **Sandbox Mode:** The credentials in this mode are used for testing.
- **Production Mode:** The credentials in this mode are used to receive payments in Production. To use the production mode credentials you must activate your credentials.
- Read [Credentials](https://www.mercadopago[FAKER][URL][DOMAIN]/developers/en/guides/credentials/credentials)

3. Once you've entered your credentials, click on the **Save Config** button located in the upper right corner. 

> It is important that you save your credentials before continuing, as this will enable the means of payment available for your country.
