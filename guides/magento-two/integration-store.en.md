3. In the **Category of your store** field, select the **category of your store**.
4. In **Use Mercado Pago Success Pago**, you can indicate whether or not the Mercado Pago success page will be enabled after the sales have been made. The page is prepared to display messages for each payment status.
5. In the **Show Discount Coupon** field, you can enable this option to display the discount coupon value in the order details.
