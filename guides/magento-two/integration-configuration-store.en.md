# Store settings

Once the credentials and payment notifications are configured, configure your store's business information. To do this, follow the steps below.

1. Go to the **Stores > Configuration > Sales > Payment Methods** menu.
2. Next, access the **Mercado Pago > Advanced** section. There you will find the fields to fill in according to your business information.
3. In the **Category of your store** field, select the **category of your store**.
4. In **Use Mercado Pago Success Pago**, indicate whether or not the Mercado Pago success page will be enabled after sales are made. This page is prepared to display messages for each payment status.
5. In the **Show Discount Coupon** field, enable the option to display the discount coupon value in the order details.
6. If you are a member of the **&lt;dev&gt;program**, the Mercado Pago developer program, enter your integrator_id as a member of the program. If you are still a member, [click here](https://www.mercadopago[FAKER][URL][DOMAIN]/developers/pt/developer-program) for more information.
7. In the **Log to File** field you can enable the option to generate a file called `mercadopago.log`. This file will be created in your store's log folder (var/log) and will contain the debug module, which will help you understand the module's behavior.
8. Once the necessary settings have been made, click on the **Save Config** button in the upper right corner.
