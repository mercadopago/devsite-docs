# Configure offline payments (ticket)

With **ticket**, offer the buyer the option to make payments using offline payment methods (cash and ATM), using the [Checkout API](/developers/en/guides/checkout-api/landing).

To integrate the payment method, follow the steps below.

1. Go to the **Stores > Configuration > Sales > Payment Methods** menu.
2. To activate card payments, access the **Mercado Pago > Custom Checkout - Offline Payments Methods (Ticket)** section.
3. Select **Yes** to enable the offline payments experience at your store checkout.
4. If necessary, **change the title of the payment method** that will appear for the buyer.
5. If you wish, you can customize a **banner** with the available payment methods by changing the URL of the image in question. By default, the Mercado Pago module will configure a banner with the available payment methods according to your country.
6. In the **Exclude Payment Methods** field, select only the offline payment methods you want to accept in your store. By default, the module will show the buyer all ticket and ATM (ATM) payment methods.
7. In **Checkout Position**, indicate the position in which the payment method will be available to the buyer in the checkout flow.
8. Then click** **Save Config** to save your preferences.
