# Payment configuration

The integration of the Mercado Pago module with the Magento 2 store allows you to use two types of checkouts to receive payments for your sales, namely:

----[mlb]----
* [Checkout Transparente](/developers/en/docs/magento-two/payment-configuration/checkout-api): payment is made out without leaving your virtual store with cards (debit or credit), offline payments (boleto bancário and ATM) and Pix.
* [Checkout Pro](/developers/en/docs/prestashop/payment-configuration/checkout-pro): payment is made on the Mercado Pago page (inside or outside your store) with cards (debit or credit), cash (boleto bancário) and Pix.
------------

----[mla, mlm, mpe, mco, mlu, mlc]----
* [Checkout API](/developers/en/docs/magento-two/payment-configuration/checkout-api): payment is made out without leaving your virtual store with cards (debit or credit), offline payments (ticket and ATM) and Pix.
* [Checkout Pro](/developers/en/docs/prestashop/payment-configuration/checkout-pro): payment is made on the Mercado Pago page (inside or outside your store) with cards (debit or credit), cash (ticket) and bank transfer.
