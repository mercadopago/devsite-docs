2. In the **Merchant Country** field, select the country of operation for your store.
2. Next, access the **Mercado Pago > Credentials** section to enable the payment methods available in the store's country of origin.
3. On the page in question, you will find the **Public key** and **Access token** fields, which you must fill in with the [credentials](/developers/en/guides/additional-content/credentials/credentials) of **production** or **test** indicated in your [Dashboard](/developers/en/guides/additional-content/dashboard/introduction). The filling must be in accordance with the payment flow that you will be configuring, that is, if it will be an **integration test** or if the store will **go into production**.
3. After setting your credentials, click the **Save Config** button in the upper right corner. It is important that you save your credentials before proceeding as this will enable the payment methods available in your country.
