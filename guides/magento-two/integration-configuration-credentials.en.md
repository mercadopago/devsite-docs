# Configure your credentials

To integrate with Mercado Pago, you must first enter your credentials to enable the payment methods available in the store's country of origin. To do this, follow the steps below.

1. Go to the **Stores > Configuration > Sales > Payment Methods** menu.
2. In the **Merchant Country** field, select the country of operation for your store.
2. Next, access the **Mercado Pago > Credentials** section to enable the payment methods available in the store's country of origin.
3. On the page in question, you will find the **Public key** and **Access token** fields, which you must fill in with the [credentials](/developers/en/guides/additional-content/credentials/credentials) of **production** or **test** indicated in your [Dashboard](/developers/en/guides/additional-content/dashboard/introduction). The filling must be in accordance with the payment flow that you will be configuring, that is, if it will be an **integration test** or if the store will **go into production**.
3. After setting your credentials, click the **Save Config** button in the upper right corner. It is important that you save your credentials before proceeding as this will enable the payment methods available in your country.
