> The [credentials](https://www.mercadopago[FAKER][URL][DOMAIN]/developers/en/guides/faqs/credentials) are the keys that uniquely identify you within Mercado Pago. They will allow you to simulate payments in a test environment and receive real payments once you are ready to go to production.


### How to test the checkout?

The Mercado Pago app extension comes with the default testing environment, so that you can simulate payments in the store and verify that everything works well before you start receiving real payments from your customers.
 
This is where the test credentials you entered in the module when integrating Mercado Pago to your store come into play.

When you test, check that the payment flow works correctly.

**When you see that everything is going well, deactivate the Tests mode and go to the Production mode to receive real payments.**


### Go to production

To start receiving payments, you must [activate your credentials]([FAKER][CREDENTIALS][URL]/).

> Check the [requirements to go to production](https://www.mercadopago[FAKER][URL][DOMAIN]/developers/en/guides/payments/api/goto-production) if you have any questions about the process.

To activate them, make sure that the production credentials entered are those of the account that you receive money from sales.

Activate the Production mode only if you are ready to sell and you have tested the checkout with simulated payments in the testing phase.

**Done! Mercado Pago Transparent Checkout is ready to receive payments online.**
