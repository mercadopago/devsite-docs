# Integrate Mercado Pago
<br/>

Connect a Mercado Pago account to the module to capture your sales charges in WooCommerce. It’s easy! You only need to have a merchant account in Mercado Pago and obtain the test and production credentials.

> You don't need to know how to design or program to activate Mercado Pago in your WooCommerce store.

Once the module is installed, follow these steps to integrate:

1. Create a [seller account](https://www.mercadopago[FAKER][URL][DOMAIN]/registration-company?confirmation_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mercadopago[FAKER][URL][DOMAIN]%2Fcomo-cobrar) in Mercado Pago if you don’t have one yet.
2. Obtain the Access Token and Public Key [credencials]([FAKER][CREDENTIALS][URL]) and paste them into the Production and Testing fields that you will find in the module configuration.
3. Approve the account to [go to production](https://www.mercadopago[FAKER][URL][DOMAIN]/developers/en/guides/online-payments/checkout-api/goto-production) and receive money from your sales in Mercado Pago.

Done! With this you can capture the payments you receive in WooCommerce with your Mercado Pago account.

> Important
>
> The [credentials](https://www.mercadopago[FAKER][URL][DOMAIN]/developers/en/guides/resources/localization/credentials) are the keys that uniquely identify you within the platform. To operate in a **test environment** with which to simulate online payments, use the test credentials. Use **production** credentials to receive real payments.
