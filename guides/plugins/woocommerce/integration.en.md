# Integration setup

Currently, there are four types of checkout available for WooCommerce. If you want to configure all payment methods offered, you must do the processes individually. Otherwise, choose the one that best suits your business and configure it as follows:

1. Access the WordPress **Panel**.
2. Click on **Plugins > Installed Plugins**.
3. Search for **Mercado Pago payments for WooCommerce** and click on **Set up**.
4. Select **1 or more checkouts/payment options** you want to offer and click on **Manage** to open the plugin management screen.

On the plugin management screen, fill in the required fields according to your business information. Take into account the information in the sections below: 

## Country of operation

In the **In which country does your Mercado Pago account operate?** field, you must choose the country in which your Mercado Pago account operates. 

## Credentials activation

In the **Add credentials to "Test Mode" or "Production Mode"** section, you must fill in your **production** and **test** credentials.

The **Production credential** will enable the store to process actual sales at the end of the initial tests. It is through this credential that the activation is complete.

The **Test credential** will be necessary at first to carry out tests to ensure the correct functioning of the purchase and payment flow.

To activate the credentials, follow the steps below.

1. Scroll down to the **Credentials** section.
2. On **Add credentials to "Test Mode"or "Production Mode"**, choose **Activate Test Mode for Mercado Pago checkouts**. (By keeping this field enabled, your store will be in **test mode**, which allows you to test the plugin before setting the store to production).
3. Enter your **test** and **production** credentials in the required fields. If you don't have this information, access the [Credentials](https://www.mercadopago.[FAKER][URL][DOMAIN]/developers/en/guides/resources/credentials) documentation and follow the required steps. 
4. When finished filling in, click on **Save changes**.

Set up the business information as shown in the next section once you fill in the credentials.
