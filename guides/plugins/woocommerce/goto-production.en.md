# Activating production mode

The first step to activate production mode in your store is **enabling the SSL certificate** on your domain. This certificate is used to increase the security of the data shared by your store. In other words, your customers' personal information.

Many hosting services offer, along with the domain, the SSL certificate. If your domain does not have this certificate, we recommend looking for a company that helps you with purchase and installation. 

For more information, check our documentation [Requirements for the production environment](https://www.mercadopago[FAKER][URL][DOMAIN]/developers/en/guides/online-payments/checkout-api/goto-production).

With the certificate activated and testing completed, you can toggle your store out of *Test mode* and enable the **Production** environment, allowing you to make actual sales.

Follow the steps below to make the change:

1. Access your WordPress Panel.
2. In the left side bar, click on **WooCommerce > Settings**.
3. In **Payments**, search for the checkout you chose in step **Integration setup**, and click on **Manage**.
4. In **Add credentials to "Test Mode" or "Production Mode"**, choose **Activate Production Mode for Mercado Pago checkouts**. 
5. Click on **Save Changes**.

Done! Your store is in the Production environment and ready to process your sales.
