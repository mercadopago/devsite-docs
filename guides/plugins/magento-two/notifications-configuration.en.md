# Payment notifications configuration

To configure the order status for payment notifications, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the menu Stores > Configuration > Sales > Payment Methods.

2. To configure the payment statuses, access the ** Mercado Pago - Global Configuration ** option and navigate to the "Order Status Options" option.
For each payment status, you can select an order status. Then, when your store receives a payment notification, the module will automatically update the order with the configured status.
