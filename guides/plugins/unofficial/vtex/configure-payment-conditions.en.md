# Configure payment conditions

**Payment conditions** are the payment methods that are displayed on the website for the checkout. They allow the configuration of fees, interests, special conditions, etc.

After you have created your affiliation with **MercadoPagoV2**, you must configure the **payment conditions** that will be offered to buyers.

> Verify in your VTEX application store that the App **Mercado Pago Payment APP** has been installed to use the **MercadoPagoPro, MercadoPagoWallet and MercadoPagoOff**  payment conditions, or request its installation by the VTEX team through [VTEX Support](https://help.vtex.com/en/support).

The configuration of payment conditions is done in the **Payment conditions** tab of the **Settings** menu in the **Payments** module in the VTEX platform administrator portal. In this tab, you must click on the "+" button (*Add new payment condition for ...*) and select on eof the following payment conditions:

* **Credit Card:** this refers to credit card transactions carried out on your store's website. This setup requires you to select each credit card brand that you want in your store.

In addition, depending on the payment terms you select (Cash or Installments), your configuration may require you to fill in additional fields.

* **Other:** this refers to transactions with  **MercadoPagoOff**, **MercadoPagoWallet**, or **MercadoPagoPro**.
  * If you configure **MercadoPagoPro**, the buyer will make the payment in the Mercado Pago environment, via a form presented directly in their store and will have access to all payment methods available on the platform.
  * If you configure **MercadoPagoWallet**, the buyer will use their Mercado Pago wallet. This mode is exclusive to buyers registered in Mercado Pago or Mercado Libre and we suggest using it if you select **Credit Card Payment Condition**.
