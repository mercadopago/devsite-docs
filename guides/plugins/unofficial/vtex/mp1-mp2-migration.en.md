# Gateway version migration

If you registered a **MercadoPagoV1** affiliation, you can **migrate from MercadoPagoV1 to MercadoPagoV2**.

> WARNING
>
> Important
>
> The MercadoPago and MercadoPagoV1 affiliations will be discontinued, since they only processed the Credit and Debit Card payment condition. Currently, these same conditions are available in MercadoPagoV2.

To perform the migration, you must simply follow these steps:

1. Register a payment gateway affiliated to **MercadoPagoV2**.
2. In the Payment Conditions, change the **Process with affiliation** to the new one you created.
3. Edit this in all the existing conditions in your electronic store.
