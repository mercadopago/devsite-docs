# Getting started

Mercado Pago offers several solutions that allow you to receive virtual or in-person payments. You can provide payment methods without contracts or monthly fees, through integrations with online stores or products, such as a payment link, QR Code, and the Mercado Pago machine, the Point, which may or may not be integrated.

In the case of integrable solutions, the initial integration flow is always the same: the first step is to have a Mercado Pago account, as this is where the sale payments will be sent.

> Important
>
> If you already have a Mercado Livre account, access the Mercado Pago Business Panel with the same login and password.

With the account already active, you have access to two different dashboards with crucial information:

* The [Business Panel](https://www.mercadopago[FAKER][URL][DOMAIN]/subscription-plans/list#from-section=menu) allows you to manage profile and financial activity, considering cash fronts, billing, metrics, employees, product catalog, and much more.
* The [Dashboard](https://www.mercadopago[FAKER][URL][DOMAIN]/developers/panel) allows you to manage integrations with code development.

In the [Business Panel](https://www.mercadopago[FAKER][URL][DOMAIN]/subscription-plans/list#from-section=menu) and the [Dashboard](https://www.mercadopago[FAKER][URL][DOMAIN]/developers/panel), you have access to your [credentials](https://www.mercadopago[FAKER][URL][DOMAIN]/developers/pt/guides/resources/credentials), which are unique passwords responsible for securely capturing payments in virtual stores and other applications, and with which we identify an integration in your account.

With credentials in hand, you can integrate solutions connecting them to e-commerce platforms avaliá-lo or getting your hands dirty writing lines of code.

> WARNING

> Caution
>
> If you are not a developer, we recommend that you integrate Mercado Pago's payment solutions connecting them to one or more than the 80 e-commerce platforms available.

## Connecting to platforms

Integrating solutions to the available platforms is simple and fast. The entire process is done on the Mercado Pago business panel and within the platform itself.

In just a few steps you will have an online store ready to process your payments  without the need for additional configurations.


> Check out the documentation of the chosen platform and integrate.

## Writing code lines

On the other hand, integrating the solutions by getting your hands dirty  and writing lines of code guarantees greater flexibility to customize the way the store operates.

In this case, you can integrate the solutions via SDK or plugin and perform customizations via REST API or SDK.
