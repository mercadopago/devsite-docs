# Activation of production mode

After performing the integration and testing, your store is ready to go into production.
 
To start receiving payments you need to activate Production mode. To do this, follow the procedures below.
 
1. On the Admin Panel of your Prestashop store, access the **Modules and Services** menu, find the Mercado Pago plugin and click on **configure**.
2. On the plugin management screen, confirm that the production [credentials](https://www.mercadopago[FAKER][URL][DOMAIN]/developers/en/guides/credentials/credentials) are the same as the account that you get money from sales. This information can be viewed on your [Dashboard](https://www.mercadopago[FAKER][URL][DOMAIN]/developers/en/guides/additional-content/dashboard/introduction).
3. Then click on **yes** to activate Production mode.
 
Ready! The Mercado Pago plugin is ready to receive payments online.
