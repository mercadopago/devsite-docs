# Checkout Pro

----[mlb]----

The first phase of the Mercado Pago integration with Shopify is the installation of [Checkout Pro](/developers/en/guides/checkout-pro/landing). In this checkout model, the customer is redirected to a Mercado Pago page where you must fill in the requested information and complete the payment.

If you already have Checkout Pro installed, [click here](/developers/en/docs/shopify/checkout-api/installation) and follow the steps to install Checkout API.

> Mercado Pago's Checkout Pro is installed exclusively in **Production mode**, that is, it already allows the processing of real payments. This means that **you don't need to set up a production mode** to start receiving payments made in your store.
