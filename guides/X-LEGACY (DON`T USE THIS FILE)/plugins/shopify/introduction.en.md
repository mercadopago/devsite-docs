[Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/?shpxid=76f6bf35-F67D-4311-0725-B4A8C1AC2254) is an e-commerce platform that offers all the features you need to make online sales.

By integrating Mercado Pago into your Shopify, you will be able to receive payments through [Checkout Pro](/developers/en/docs/shopify/checkout-pro), where the buyer is redirected to a Mercado Pago page to complete the payment, or to the [Checkout API](/developers/en/docs/shopify/checkout-api) that allows the buyer to carry out the entire payment process within the environment of your store.

If you prefer, you can use only one type of checkout in your store (Checkout Pro or Checkout API), however, **to offer Checkout API, it is mandatory to integrate Checkout Pro first**.

To perform the integration, you will need to follow the steps below.

1. [Install Checkout Pro](/developers/en/docs/shopify/checkout-pro/installation)
2. [Install Checkout API](/developers/en/docs/shopify/checkout-api/installation)
