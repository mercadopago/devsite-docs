# Notification email

Having selected **Checkout API** to receive payments from your store, it is important to configure the email notifications that will notify the user of their transactions. See below how to customize  **transactional email** notifications in the WooCommerce management panel.

1. In **E-mails**, enable the notifications to be configured by selecting the option Ëœactivate this notification e-mail".
2. Customize the email template with: recipients, email subject and header.
3. Enter the **content** to be sent and select the e-mail type.
4. Also indicate the sender's name and email address, as well as your store's logo and colors.
5. Once the necessary settings have been made, install and configure a **SMTP server** of your choice to enable e-mail notifications.
6. Send a **test email** to ensure the platform is sending emails correctly.
