# Integration setup 

Currently, there are four types of checkout available for WooCommerce. If you want to configure all payment methods offered, you must do the processes individually. Otherwise, choose the one that best suits your business and configure it as follows:

1. Access the WordPress **Panel**.
2. Click on **Plugins > Installed Plugins**.
3. Search for **Mercado Pago payments for WooCommerce** and click on **Set up**.
4. Select **1 or more checkouts/payment options** you want to offer and click on **Manage** to open the plugin management screen.

On the plugin management screen, fill in the required fields according to your business information. Take into account the information in the sections below: 

> NEXT_STEP_CARD_PT
>
> Country of operation
>
> Check how to define the country of operation of your store.
