# What is Payment Link?

Payment Link is a quick and practical payment solution that allows you to sell online without the need for technical or programming knowledge.

The **payment link** will help you to charge online using very simple steps.
If you have a website, you can simply insert an HTML code that will show a **payment button** on your page.

## How does it work?
 - From your Mercado Pago account, access [Payment Link](https://www.mercadopago[FAKER][URL][DOMAIN]/tools/list) and select the *Create New* option.
 - Set the title and price of your product or service. You can also add a photo.
 - Choose where you want to sell: social media, email or website and you're done!

> It is not necessary for your customer to have a Mercado Pago account in order to make the payment!
