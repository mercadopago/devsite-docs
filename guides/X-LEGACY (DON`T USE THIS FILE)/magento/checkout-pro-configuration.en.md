# Configure Checkout Pro

This process will explain how to configure the module to accept payments with Checkout Pro using Redirect, Iframe or Lightbox:

1. Navigate to the menu Stores > Configuration > Sales > Payment Methods.

2. To configure the credentials, access the Mercado Pago - Classic Checkout option and click on “Configure”. There you will find the **Client id** and **Client secret** fields. Complete them with your production [Credentials]([FAKER][CREDENTIALS][URL]).

3. Now you can enable the payment method. To do that, navigate to the “Enable” option and select **Yes**. In this step, you can also configure the **Checkout Type** and choose if the user should automatically return to your store at the end of the payment (Auto Redirect).
