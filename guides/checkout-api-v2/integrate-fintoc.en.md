# Fintoc

Fintoc is an application that allows you to receive payments and make recurring charges with any bank in Chile, with automatic reconciliation.

With Checkout ----[mla, mlm, mlu, mco, mlc, mpe]----API----------------[mlb]---- Transparente------------, it is possible to offer this payment option by performing two different types of integration:

* [Simplified integration](): this is an easy way to set up your integration, based on redirecting to Mercado Pago, where the customer can pay using a pre-prepared *widget*. This integration can be used for both web, whether in desktop or responsive mode, and for mobile, through the WebView model.

* [Advanced integration](): this allows you to fully and transparently control the flow of the experience within the store, thanks to the availability of specific methods in our SDKs. This integration can only be used in web browsers.

Select the type of integration that best suits your needs and follow the step-by-step guide to offer Fintoc as a payment method in Checkout ----[mla, mlm, mlu, mco, mlc, mpe]----API----------------[mlb]---- Transparente------------.
