The three types of integration mentioned above are eligible for **PCI SAQ A certification**. This is because **card data**, **CVV** and **expiration date** travel through an iframe directly to Mercado Pago servers, which prevent PCI data (card number, security code and expiration date) from being accessible to third parties.

In addition to the payment methods shown in the table above, it is also possible to offer other payment methods. For a detailed list of all available options for integration, send a **GET** to the endpoint [/v1/payment_methods](/developers/en/reference/payment_methods/_payment_methods/get) and execute the request. In the answer you will have access to each of the options.
