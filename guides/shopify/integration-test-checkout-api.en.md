# Make a test

The test purchases ensure that payments are processed correctly before allowing actual sales. Follow the steps below to make a test purchase:

1. Go to the store's home page and **select a product to purchase**.
2. Click on **Buy**, and continue with your cart.
3. Enter the purchase information requested with an e-mail, address, and a valid zip code according to the country where the store operates, to simulate the shipping. Click on **Continue **.
4. Complete the required fields and select Credit or Debit Card as the payment method.
5. On the checkout screen, use the [test cards](/developers/en/docs/shopify/test-cards) to make the payment. **Important**: don't log into your Mercado Pago account or try to make the payment with cards for personal use.
6. Enter the test card information provided, and click on **Pay**.
7. After the checkout, log into the Shopify Admin Panel and verify that the order is listed as approved.
