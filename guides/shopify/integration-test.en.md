> During testing, you will be operating in the production environment. However, this is a test in which you will be using fictitious credentials to simulate real scenarios. After completing the tests, remember to replace the seller's credentials (both production and test) entered in the plugin panel in steps 8 with the actual credentials from your Mercado Pago account. This action will allow you to continue selling in your store and avoid confusion.

After completing a test purchase using Checkout Pro----[mlb]---- or Checkout Transparente------------, the purchase approval will be visible in the Shopify Admin Panel, except for purchases made offline----[mlb]---- and Pix------------, which will remain with pending status.

Furthermore, orders will be recorded in the history of the Mercado Pago test seller account.
