# Configuration

We recommend you customize the checkout information of the store to ensure a better shopping experience and a smoother integration between Checkout Transparente and Shopify. To do so, follow the steps below:

## Configure the company name

1. Go to your [Shopify](https://accounts.shopify.com/store-login) store.
2. In the store's administrative panel, click on **Settings**.
3. Once there, select the **Checkout** option.
4. In the **Customer Information** section, select the field "Company Name" as required.

## Configure the store language 

1. In the store's administrative panel, click on **Settings**. There, click on **Languages**.
2. In the Default Language section, you can choose the language in which the store will operate. Click **Change default**.  
3. On the next screen, choose a language, and click on the **Save** button.

## Set values of buyer's identification

The Shopify store will display the request fields of the buyer's identification with the term "Company". To replace it with the identification requested according to the country where the store operates, follow these steps:

1. Use the search bar on the site to search for the word "Company". The search will return several fields that you can edit.
2. Replace the following entries with the identification type that your store will request according to the country where it operates (e.g. CPF for Brazil):
    * **Company label**
    * **Optional company label**
    * **Address company blank**
    * **Address – Company**
3. Click on Save.
