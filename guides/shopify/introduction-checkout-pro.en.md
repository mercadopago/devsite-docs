# Introduction

With Mercado Pago’s Checkout Pro, **buyers will be redirected from the store to the Mercado Pago's site** where they must enter the requested information and pay. Therefore, transactions are processed and completed out of your store environment. When transactions are completed, buyers can be redirected to your store.

**Mercado Pago’s Checkout Pro is exclusively installed in a production environment**, allowing to process actual payments. With this method, you will not need to set a production mode up to start receiving payments in the store.
