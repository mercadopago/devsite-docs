# Cards

**Mercado Pago Cards** ([Checkout Transparente](/developers/en/docs/checkout-api/landing)) is an app that allows transparent payments with debit or credit cards, where the entire checkout process happens within the online store environment, without the need to redirect to an external page. In addition to providing greater control in the customization and integration process, it reduces cart abandonment and increases the possibility of conversion.

> WARNING
>
> Attention
>
> The new app is only for card payments. To process payments with **Pix** or **boleto bancÃ¡rio**, use [Mercado Pago Checkout Pro](/developers/en/docs/shopify/integration-configuration/checkout-pro).
> <br><br>
> We will soon announce the launch of the new app exclusively for Pix and provide the necessary documentation for migration or installation.
