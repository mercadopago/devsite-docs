# Checkout Transparente

With the [Checkout Transparente](/developers/en/docs/checkout-api/landing), the entire checkout process will take place within the online store environment, without the need to redirect to an external page. In addition to allowing greater control in the customization and integration process, the checkout offers a complete structure for processing payments with the main means available on the market.

> WARNING
>
> Attention
>
> Due to the need to comply with the new payment app rules on the Shopify platform, where each payment method must have its own app, **the current Checkout Transparente app is incompatible for integration with new stores due to the platform's existing rules (Checkout Extensibility)**. Therefore, we are developing new Mercado Pago payment apps for Shopify, and they will be available soon.
> <br><br>
> To integrate Checkout Transparente you must have Checkout Pro ("**Checkout Mercado Pago**") in your Shopify store. To learn how to integrate it, go to the [documentation.](/developers/en/docs/shopify/integration-configuration/checkout-pro)

To install Checkout Transparente in a Shopify store, follow the steps below:

1. Go to your [Shopify](https://accounts.shopify.com/store-login) store.
2. Access the installation site of Mercado Pagoâ€™s Checkout Transparent [clicking here](https://apps.shopify.com/checkout-transparente-mp).
3. Click on the **Add app** button. You will be redirected to an authorization screen, where the permissions you grant to Checkout Transparent's application will be displayed. To continue, click on **Install app**. 
4. On the next screen, put your **production credentials** (`public key` and `access token`) in the fields that request it. Go to [Dashboard](https://www.mercadopago.com.ar/developers/panel/app) to get the credentials of your application and, if you have not created an application yet, check [this documentation](/developers/en/docs/shopify/additional-content/your-integrations/introduction) to learn how to create it.
5. In the field **How do you want to operate?**, select the option "I want to test my store" to perform test transactions and ensure the smooth operation of the checkout.
6. Then, you can **configure installments and interests** in case you want the store to offer this. To configure it, click on **Edit**.
7. In the section **What payment methods do you want to offer?**, select the type of payment methods that the store will offer through Checkout Transparent. You can choose Mercado Pago, credit cards, boleto, or Pix.
8. Click on **Save changes** to complete the installation.

> In case of renewing your credentials, remember to replace both the production and test credentials in your integration.
