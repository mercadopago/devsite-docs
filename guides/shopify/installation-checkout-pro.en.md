# Installation

To install Checkout Pro in a Shopify store, follow the steps below:

1. Go to your [Shopify](https://accounts.shopify.com/store-login) store.
2. In the store's administrative panel, click on **Settings**.
3. Once there, select the **Payments** option. Then, click on the **Choose a provider** button.
4. Type Mercado Pago in the search bar. Once you find it, select it as your payment method.
5. Enter your **production credentials** Client_id and Client_secret in the fields that require them. Remember to keep your [credentials](/developers/en/docs/shopify/additional-content/credentials) handy.
6. In the next step, you will be able to select the images of the payment methods you want to display in the store. **Important: these images are for illustrative purposes only and do not imply the activation of the payment method selected**.
7. Lastly, the store will offer you the option to **Enable test mode**. Activate this option if you prefer the store to remain in a test environment and not published to customers. **To switch the store to productive mode and receive actual payments, keep this change disabled**. 
8. To finish, click on **Activate Mercado Pago**. 
 
> In case of renewing your credentials, remember to replace both the production and test credentials in your integration.
