# Installation

To install Checkout Transparent in a Shopify store, follow the steps below:

1. Go to your [Shopify](https://accounts.shopify.com/store-login) store.
2. Access the installation site of Mercado Pagoâ€™s Checkout Transparent [clicking here](https://apps.shopify.com/checkout-transparente-mp).
3. Click on the **Add app** button. You will be redirected to an authorization screen, where the permissions you grant to Checkout Transparent's application will be displayed. To continue, click on **Install app**. 
4. On the next screen, you must enter your test and production Public Key and Access Token credentials. Go to [Dashboard](https://www.mercadopago.com.ar/developers/panel) to get the credentials of your application. If you have not created an application yet, learn how to do it in [this documentation](/developers/en/docs/shopify/additional-content/dashboard/introduction).  
5. In the field **How do you want to operate?**, select the option "I want to test my store" to perform test transactions and ensure the smooth operation of the checkout.
6. Then, you can **configure installments and interests** in case you want the store to offer this. To configure it, click on **Edit**.
7. In the section **What payment methods do you want to offer?**, select the type of payment methods that the store will offer through Checkout Transparent. You can choose Mercado Pago, credit cards, boleto, or Pix.
8. Click on **Save changes** to complete the installation.

> In case of renewing your credentials, remember to replace both the production and test credentials in your integration.
