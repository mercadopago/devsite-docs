# Prerequisites

To integrate the payment solution without the need to use the Card Verification Value (CVV) for recurring payments, you must meet the requirements listed below.

| Requirements | Description | 
| --- | --- |
| Business contact | To use the automatic payments feature, it is necessary to get in touch with your commercial representative at Mercado Pago, who will provide all the necessary information to complete the integration. |
| Mercado Pago or Mercado Libre seller account | To use the automatic payments feature you need a seller account on Mercado Pago or Mercado Libre. If not, [click here](https://www.mercadopago[FAKER][URL][DOMAIN]/hub/registration/landing) to create it for free. |
| Application | Applications are the different integrations in one or more stores. You can create an application for each solution you implement to keep everything organized and on track for easier management. To operate automatic payments without CVV, the application must be enabled for this purpose. These permissions are granted by Mercado Pago, so you must send us the **application ID** to carry out the corresponding configuration. <br><br> Check [Your integrations](/developers/en/docs/your-integrations/introduction) for more information on how to create an application. |

If all the prerequisites have been met, you can proceed with the integration.
