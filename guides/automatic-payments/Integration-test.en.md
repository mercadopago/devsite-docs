# Integration test

It is crucial to test the entire flow before going into production, ensuring that payment creation is done correctly and that messages are effective in communicating with the user. A good experience for your customers at the checkout helps improve conversion.

To perform a test purchase, it is necessary to use the **test credentials of your production user**. To obtain them, access **Application details > Credentials** within the [Developer dashboard](/developers/panel/app) or in your Mercado Pago account by accessing [Your Business > Settings > Management and Administration > Credentials](https://www.mercadopago[FAKER][URL][DOMAIN]/settings/account/credentials).
