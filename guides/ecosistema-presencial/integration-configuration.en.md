# Configure the integration


To start integrating into the Instore API, you should have your integration configured, create your location and register, and log in to your Point device. To do that, follow the steps below:

1. [Create an application in Your Integrations](/developers/en/docs/ecosistema-presencial/integration-configuration/create-app)
2. [Create the store and the point of sale](/developers/en/docs/ecosistema-presencial/integration-configuration/create-store-point-of-sale)
3. If you want to integrate with Point, you must [log in to a Point device](/developers/en/docs/ecosistema-presencial/integration-configuration/signin-point).
4. If you have already logged in, you must [activate the PDV mode on the device](/developers/en/docs/ecosistema-presencial/integration-configuration/enable-pdv) to complete your integration with Point.
