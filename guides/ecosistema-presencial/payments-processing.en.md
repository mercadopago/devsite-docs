# Create and manage intents

An intent is a payment intention that contains the details of the transaction to be carried out. The intent must be created for this transaction to be processed.

> Prior to creating an intent, we recommend creating [test accounts](/developers/en/docs/ecosistema-presencial/additional-content/your-integrations/test/accounts) to test the proper functioning of your integration and payment flows.
