# Payment configuration

The integration of the Mercado Pago module with Tiendanube stores allows you to use two types of checkouts to receive payments for your sales, namely:

----[mlb]----
* [Checkout Pro](/developers/en/docs/nuvemshop/payment-configuration/checkout-pro): payment is made on the Mercado Pago page and buyers can pay using a Mercado Pago account, making it easier to pay with a credit card , debit and other means of payment (Pix, bank slip, lottery payment without slip, balance in Mercado Pago account and Mercado Credit).
* [Transparent Checkout](/developers/en/docs/nuvemshop/payment-configuration/checkout-api): payment is made without leaving your virtual store with Pix, credit card and bank slip.

> The Pix payment option will only be displayed if there is a Pix key registered with Mercado Pago. If you haven't created it yet, [click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60tApKYVnkA) and see the step by step.
