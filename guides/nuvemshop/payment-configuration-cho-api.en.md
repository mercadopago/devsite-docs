# Checkout API

With [Checkout API](/developers/en/docs/checkout-pro/landing), the entire checkout process will take place within the online store environment, without the need to redirect to an external page. In addition to allowing greater control in the customization and integration process, the checkout offers a complete structure for processing payments with the main means available on the market.

To integrate the Checkout API, follow the steps below.

1. In your store's Administrative Panel at Nuvemshop, access **My apps - See all apps**.
2. Locate the Mercado Pago plugin in the list of applications and click on **Configure application**.
3. In the list of payment methods, locate the Mercado Pago plugin and click on **Edit**.
4. To configure your store's payment experiences, click on **Edit on the Mercado Pago website**.
5. In Transparent Checkout, choose the payment methods you want to offer in the Mercado Pago payment environment, which can be:
