# Checkout Pro
 
When installing [Checkout Pro](/developers/en/docs/checkout-pro/landing), there may be an **increase in the approval rate of online store sales**. This happens because buyers will be able to pay using a Mercado Pago account and the entire purchase process will be done in our environment, which facilitates payment. At the end of the transaction, these buyers are redirected to the store environment.
 
To integrate Checkout Pro, follow the steps below.
 
1. In your store's Administrative Panel at Nuvemshop, access **Potencializar > My apps**. 
2. Locate the Mercado Pago plugin in the list of applications and click on **Configure application**.
3. In the list of payment methods, locate the Mercado Pago plugin and click on **Edit**.
4. To configure your store's payment experiences, click on **Edit on the Mercado Pago website**.
5. In Mercado Pago Checkout, choose the payment methods you want to offer in the Mercado Pago payment environment, which can be:
 ----[mlb]----
 * **Credit card**. Select the brands you want to enable in your store and also indicate the **maximum number of installments to be allowed for purchases in installments**. 
 * **Debit card**. Select the flags you want to enable in your store. 
 * **Other payment methods**. Select other types of payment methods you want to enable in your store, such as Pix, Cardless installments (if you want to display this option at your store checkout, read the [documentation](/developers/en/docs/nuvemshop/payments-configuration/mercado-credito)), bank slip (also indicate, in the field below, the **number of days for the slip to expire**), etc. The payment option with Pix will only be displayed if there is a Pix key registered in the Market Paid.
