# Installments without card

**Mercado Credits** is Mercado Pagoâ€™s financing method that allows paying in installments without having a card.

With this line of credit, administered by Mercado Pago, the payment is credited in full to the seller's account, while the customer can choose to pay in up to 12 fixed monthly installments, no card needed. The user just has to enter their Mercado Pago account (or create one), determine their available limit, and choose how many installments they want to pay in.
 
**Mercado Credits** is currently offered in our [Checkout Pro](/developers/en/docs/checkout-pro/landing) (**Checkout Mercado Pago**), and now it is also possible to access directly from the store checkout. 

> If you haven't set up Checkout Pro yet, you must access the [Payment configuration > Checkout Pro](/developers/en/docs/nuvemshop/payments-configuration/checkout-pro) section.
