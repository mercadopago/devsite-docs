# Main app distribution

For the distribution phase of your solution, follow these steps:

1. Share with Mercado Pago the list of devices, users, cash registers and branches that the application will use. This way, the team can pre-configure the POS.
2. If you are going to obtain information from the seller or perform operations on the account, define the validation of the [OAuth flow](/developers/en/docs/main-apps/additional-content/security/oauth/introduction) as part of the onboarding. 
3. To upload your solution to the Mercado Pago ecosystem, guaranteeing the security of the application and its subsequent versions, digitally sign the certificate. This document must be the same for both the initial package and each update. Android provides a [step-by-step guide on how to digitally sign your app](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing#generate-key) with the certificate generated by the developer. 
4. Share the **.apk** package with the Mercado Pago support team. They will carry out a series of validations and notify the integrator company of the result.
