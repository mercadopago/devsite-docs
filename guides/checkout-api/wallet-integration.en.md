# Receive payments by Mercado Pago wallet

Add the Checkout Pro wallet mode to your integration, so that **you receive payments only from Mercado Pago registered users with their cards and available balance**.

This means that your customers have more ways to pay you and can access better benefits, without changing the dynamics of your Checkout API.
